Add an FAQ Section

What I'm going to give you:
Article URL – the page you must crawl and use as the only source of facts. [URL here]

People Also Ask (PAA) question list – pulled from Google for the target keyword. [Paste PAA here]

Target Keyword – [Target keyword]

Your tasks
1 — Build the FAQ section
Crawl the supplied URL and extract the article’s content.

For every PAA question provided, check if the answer already exists (even partially) in the article.

If it does → draft a concise, authoritative answer (2-4 sentences) using only information from the article.

If it doesn’t → skip that question. Do not invent new facts.

Format the finished FAQ block in clean HTML ready for pasting at the end of the article:

<section id="faq"> <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2> <details> <summary>Question 1?</summary> <p>Answer that cites or paraphrases the article’s content.</p> </details> <!-- repeat for every included question --> </section>

Aim for 5-10 solid Q&A pairs that strengthen topical relevance around the target keyword.

2 — Flag questions worth their own in-depth article
From the FAQ you just wrote, pick any question that could support a full follow-up article (because the answer was brief or the topic is broad).

For each selected question, provide:

Target Keyword Variant – the main phrase the new article should rank for.

Click-worthy Title Tag (≤ 60 characters).

Suggested Outline – H1 plus 3-6 H2/H3 headings.

Output this as a markdown table titled “Article Opportunities” directly beneath the FAQ block.

Output a list of PAA questions that were not answered beneath the "Article Opportunities"

Output example (truncated)

<section id="faq"> <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2> <details> <summary>Are motorized pergolas waterproof?</summary> <p>Most motorized pergolas feature interlocking louvers that form a watertight seal when fully closed, as noted in the article’s “Weather Protection” section.</p> </details> … </section> ### Article Opportunities | PAA Question | Target Keyword | Title Tag | Suggested Outline (H1 + H2s) | |--------------|---------------|-----------|------------------------------| | Are motorized pergolas waterproof? | waterproof motorized pergola | Are Motorized Pergolas Really Waterproof? | **H1:** Are Motorized Pergolas Waterproof?<br>**H2:** How Louver Seals Work<br>**H2:** Rainwater Drainage Systems<br>**H2:** Maintenance Tips for Leak-Free Performance |
