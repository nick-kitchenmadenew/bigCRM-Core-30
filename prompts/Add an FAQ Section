Prompt: Add FAQ Section + Article Opportunities (Use Only Supplied URL)

Instructions
You will create an FAQ section for an article using only the content on the provided URL. Do not add information from other sources. Follow the steps and output format exactly.

What I will provide you
- Article URL: the only source of facts. Do not use outside information.
- People Also Ask (PAA) Questions: copied from Google for the target keyword.
- Target Keyword.

Your tasks
1) Build the FAQ section
- Crawl the supplied URL and extract the article’s content.
- For each PAA question:
  - If the article directly or partially answers it, write a concise, authoritative answer (2–4 sentences) using only the article’s content (paraphrase is fine).
  - If the article does not cover it, skip the question. Do not invent facts.
- Aim for 5–10 solid Q&A pairs that reinforce the target keyword’s topic.
- Deliver the FAQ block in clean HTML using this exact structure:

<section id="faq">
  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
  <details>
    <summary>Question 1?</summary>
    <p>Answer that cites or paraphrases the article’s content.</p>
  </details>
  <!-- repeat for every included question -->
</section>

2) Identify follow-up article opportunities
- From the answered FAQs, select any questions that deserve a full article (because the topic is broad or the answer was necessarily brief).
- For each selected question, provide:
  - Target Keyword Variant (the main phrase the new article should rank for)
  - Click-worthy Title Tag (60 characters max)
  - Suggested Outline (H1 + 3–6 H2/H3 headings)
- Output this as a markdown table titled “Article Opportunities” directly beneath the FAQ block.

3) List unanswered PAA questions
- Beneath the “Article Opportunities” table, include a bulleted list titled “PAA Questions Not Answered” with the questions you skipped (verbatim).

Voice and tone
- Professional, authoritative, and easy to understand.
- No fluff. Answer customer-relevant concerns clearly.
- Mirror the style and terminology of the source article where possible.

Quality rules
- Use ONLY the provided URL as your source of truth.
- If the article is vague on a point, keep the answer conservative and aligned with what’s stated.
- Do not include prices, timelines, guarantees, or comparisons unless they appear in the article.
- Keep answers focused on the PAA. Avoid extra commentary.

Final deliverable format (exact order)
1) The HTML FAQ block
2) “### Article Opportunities” markdown heading + table with columns:
   - PAA Question | Target Keyword | Title Tag | Suggested Outline (H1 + H2/H3s)
3) “PAA Questions Not Answered” bulleted list
