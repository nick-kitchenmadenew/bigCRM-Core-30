Customer Pain Point:

Act as a no-nonsense consumer-insights investigator. Build me a detailed, plain-English list of the top pain points homeowners in [CITY] complain about when hiring a [BUSINESS_TYPE].

Scope & Structure:





Pre-Booking Frustrations – unanswered calls or slow replies, confusing quotes, hidden fees, bad online reviews, difficulty verifying licenses/insurance.



On-Site Headaches – late arrivals or no-shows, mess left behind, poor communication, unexpected upsells, technicians who rush the job or lack courtesy.



Post-Service Regrets – quality issues reappearing, warranty runarounds, surprise invoices, payment-method hassles, trouble getting follow-up support.



Emotional Fallout – feel taken advantage of, lose trust in pros, anxiety over property damage, embarrassment if job delays impact neighbors or tenants.

Format: For each pain-point category, give:
• A short, punchy title (4-6 words)
• A one-sentence description in the customer’s voice (“They say …”)
• A quick note on how frequently you hear it (e.g., “common,” “occasional but critical”)

Avoid jargon or marketing spin—write like real customers venting on Google Reviews or in a neighborhood Facebook group. End with a ranked “Top 3 deal-breakers” summary so the service team knows what to fix first.”
