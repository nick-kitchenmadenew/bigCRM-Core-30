Target Audience Prompt:


Act as a seasoned local-marketing strategist. Give me a rich, 360-degree profile of the ideal customer for a [BUSINESS_TYPE] operating in [CITY].

Break it down into:





Core Demographics – age bands, typical household makeup, homeownership status, average home value, and income range.



Psychographics & Lifestyle – daily routines, attitudes toward home maintenance, preferred communication style, and the values they look for in a service pro (speed, trust, eco-friendliness, etc.).



Local Context – neighborhood types they live in, common property or climate quirks specific to the location and how seasonality or local regulations shape their needs.



Information-Seeking Habits – where they research contractors (Google reviews, Facebook groups, Nextdoor, trade-association sites), what devices they use, and what style of content convinces them you’re “the one.”



Decision Drivers – top factors that tip them from researching to booking (social proof, clear pricing, rapid scheduling, branded vans on their street, etc.).



Customer Journey Snapshot – the typical timeline from first noticing the need to scheduling the job, including key micro-moments you must win.

Write it like a quick-read briefing for a sales team—concise, specific, and free of marketing fluff. Skip pain points for now; we’ll map those separately.”
