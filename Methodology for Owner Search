Refined search workflow and sources for a risk‑assessed Target Intelligence Report


Secretary of State entity lookup: Query pattern: "[Exact company legal name]" AND site:[state secretary of state portal] or go direct via the state’s SoS business search index. Pull entity type, status (active/dissolved), registered agent, officers/managers, formation date, and assumed names. Cross-check for the correct state of registration and any foreign registrations if the mailing address differs from principal place of business2.


State-by-state SoS directory: Use a consolidated list of the official state business search portals to quickly pivot if the entity is registered elsewhere; search the exact legal name, then variations and DBAs to find officers/members and filing PDFs for email/name leakage2.


WHOIS/domain registration: Query pattern: "whois [company domain]" or use a WHOIS lookup tool. Capture registrant/administrative contact, domain creation date, registrar, and privacy shields to infer maturity and legitimacy; compare domain age to entity formation date2.


Company website footprint: Query patterns: site:[companydomain.com] (about, leadership, team, management, founders, contact, careers); "[company name]" AND ("CEO" OR "Founder" OR "Owner" OR "Principal" OR "Managing Member" OR "President"). Owners of small businesses often appear as CEO/President/Founder/Principal; titles vary, so broaden role keywords2.


Alternative public records: Search business licenses (industry boards), county property ownership for the business address, and court dockets. Query patterns: "[business name]" AND (license number OR license lookup); county recorder "[street address]" to find deed/owner connections; court search: "[business name]" site:[state courts] to see litigation involving owners/managers2.


BBB and Chamber of Commerce: Query patterns: "BBB [business name] [city]" for accreditation profile, principals, and complaint volume; "[city] Chamber of Commerce directory [business name]" to find member contact and owner listing for SMBs2.


News and media mentions: Query patterns: "[business name]" AND (acquired OR merger OR investment OR hires OR appoints OR opens OR expansion) to surface press naming owners/execs2.


Reverse phone and address OSINT: If you only have phone/address, use reverse phone tools and business-by-phone directories to tie the number to a legal entity and individuals, then pivot to SoS and licensing searches. Query patterns: "[10-digit phone]"; "[street address]" AND (suite OR unit) AND "[business name]" to catch multi-tenant or virtual office flags2421222530.


Industry licensing verification: For regulated trades/professions, run the entity or owner name through the relevant state licensing board database to validate licensure, status, and disciplinary history. Query patterns: "[state] contractor license lookup [business name]"; use official portals (e.g., CSLB CA, NYC DOB license search)51535852.


Concrete, executable query examples


Corporate identity and officers: "[Exact Legal Name, Inc.]" site:[state secretary of state domain] OR use the state portal index; if unknown state, search: "secretary of state business search" and choose the appropriate state portal from a verified list2.


Ownership titles sweep: "site:[companydomain.com] (owner OR founder OR managing member OR principal OR president OR CEO)" and "[company name]" ("co-founder" OR "managing partner") to capture title variations typical of small businesses2.


DBA/assumed names: "[legal name]" AND ("DBA" OR "Assumed business name" OR "Fictitious business name") AND [state/county] to link storefront branding to legal owners; check state OBR/assumed name pages where applicable36.


Domain provenance vs. corporate age: "whois [companydomain.com]"; compare domain creation date and registrant data to SoS formation date to flag mismatches that may indicate rebrands or acquisitions2.


Address triangulation: ""[street number street name]" AND "[city]" AND ([business name] OR [owner last name])" to bind premises to owners via real estate or listings; then check county recorder index for property owner name and cross-reference with officer/member names from SoS filings2.


Court and regulatory exposure: "site:[state courts domain] "[business name]"" and "[business name]" AND ("consent order" OR "fine" OR "citation") for enforcement actions; combine with BBB profile to assess complaint patterns and response timeliness2.


Contact enrichment via reverse phone: Run "[company phone]" through multiple reverse lookup tools to retrieve associated names, alternate numbers, and possible emails or carriers; corroborate across at least two sources before using for outreach2122252630.


Validation and legitimacy checks


Corporate good standing: Active status on Secretary of State site, recent annual report filing, consistent registered agent, and matching principal office address; use the state portal’s record details and document images where available2.


Licensing and specialization: Confirm state/local licenses where mandated (contractors, professional services). Validate license number, status, expiration, and any discipline via official licensure search portals before engagement51535852.


Web presence integrity: Domain age, consistent corporate identity on website, privacy policy and contact details; WHOIS not necessarily public, but private registration plus brand-new domain paired with "active" entity may merit higher risk until corroborated2.


Third-party credibility: BBB listing/accreditation status and volume/resolution of complaints; Chamber membership for SMB owner identity; news mentions validating leadership and operations2.


Phone and address consistency: Reverse phone reveals owner or business match; reverse address shows multi-tenant suites/virtual offices; mismatches between SoS principal address and website/contact can signal mail drops or relocations requiring further verification24212630.


Prioritized sources and when to use them


Primary/governmental: State Secretary of State entity search portals for legal identity, ownership/officers, filings, and status; state licensing boards for regulated fields2515358.


Domain/technical: WHOIS for registrant/age and admin contacts; compare to entity filings for alignment2.


Trade/associations: Local Chamber of Commerce directories for SMB owner names; BBB for reputation and principal contacts2.


OSINT/people-data: Reverse phone/address directories to link numbers/addresses to individuals and enrich contacts; corroborate against official filings before outreach212225262430.


Risk scoring framework for cold calling


Corporate standing (0–3): 3 = Active/good standing with recent filings; 1 = delinquent/overdue annual report; 0 = dissolved/withdrawn2.


Licensing compliance (0–3): 3 = valid license(s) with no discipline; 1–2 = lapses/minor actions; 0 = unlicensed in regulated trade51535852.


Identity consistency (0–3): 3 = SoS officers match website leadership and BBB principals; 1–2 = partial match; 0 = no match or conflicting names2.


Contact reliability (0–3): 3 = direct owner/exec email/phone corroborated by ≥2 sources; 2 = switchboard + direct dial pattern inferred; 0–1 = generic form only21222526.


Reputation/exposure (0–3): 3 = positive/neutral BBB, minimal litigation; 1–2 = moderate unresolved complaints or pending suits; 0 = significant enforcement/lawsuits2.


Web/operational maturity (0–3): 3 = domain age >2 years, coherent site, consistent NAP; 1–2 = new domain or virtual office patterns; 0 = no site or mismatched domain/entity age2.


Report outline and fields to capture


Entity overview: Legal name, DBA(s), SoS registry number, entity type/status, formation date, registered agent, principal office, officers/managers with roles and filing dates2.


Contact map: Main phone, direct dials (owner/CEO/President/Managing Member/Principal), emails found or inferred, Linked corporate emails if disclosed in filings or BBB; add source confidence per datum221222526.


Licensing summary: License type/number, status, expiration, issuing board, disciplinary notes; link back to the specific state portal used for verification51535852.


Digital footprint: Domain, WHOIS summary, domain age, SSL status, website key pages (About/Team/Contact), social presence where it reveals principals; note discrepancies2.


Reputation and legal: BBB profile summary (accreditation, rating, complaint count), chambers, notable news mentions of leadership; litigation/regulatory hits and brief context2.


Risk score and rationale: Provide the 0–18 composite and a one-paragraph justification tied to evidence points above.


Execution tips for contact discovery


Title variability: When owner titles differ across SMBs, search across synonyms (Owner, Founder, Principal, Managing Member, President, Director) to avoid misses; many small-company CEOs are also owners or part-owners2.


Secretary of State PDFs: Open statement of information/annual reports—these often include individual names and sometimes direct emails embedded in filing metadata or scanned pages; note the filing year to avoid outdated contacts2.


Reverse phone corroboration: Use at least two independent reverse phone sources to confirm the same owner name before adding it as a dial target; prefer governmental/licensing or SoS confirmation where available21222526.


Regulated industries: Always verify license status before outreach; cite the exact license record in your notes to defuse objections and build credibility on calls51535852.





Add a fast SoS pivot list and query patterns by state

Use the consolidated, state-by-state Secretary of State business search directory to jump directly to the right portal when the registration state is uncertain; this is specifically called out as an effective first-line method and includes clickable indexes to each state's search tool2.
Executable query: "[Exact Legal Name]" AND site:[state SoS domain] OR use the state's official business entity search linked from the directory, then open PDFs (annual reports/statements) for officer/member names and potential emails embedded in scans2.



Enrich reverse-lookup stack for owner identity and direct contacts

Cross-check the main phone through at least two among: Whitepages reverse phone, Truecaller reverse lookup, and NumLookup; each can return owner name, carrier, and sometimes location or related profiles for corroboration212322.
Executable queries:

"[10-digit phone]" on Whitepages Reverse Phone Lookup (free basic data for landlines/business; premium for mobiles)21.
"[10-digit phone]" on Truecaller web lookup (name + spam stats; unlimited via app)23.
"[10-digit phone]" on NumLookup (owner name, telco, potential social links)22.





Validate licensure using official boards for regulated trades

For California contractors and many trades, run the business/owner through CSLB "Check a License" to verify status, classifications, and disciplinary actions16.
For New York City construction trades and general contractors, use NYC DOB Skilled Trades/GC search to validate license or registration and status history18.
Executable queries:

"site:[state board domain] [business name]" OR search directly on state licensure portals (e.g., CSLB CA; NYC DOB)1618.





Address-based legitimacy checks and entity binding

If SoS filings list only a registered agent or mail drop, run reverse address searches and compare with county property records where available to see ownership of the premises; then match surnames with SoS officers. Use reverse-address tools and county recorder sites; for multi-tenant or virtual office patterns, elevate risk flag24.
Executable query: '"[street number street name]" "[city]" AND ([business name] OR owner last name)' then pivot to county recorder index.



BBB and chamber profiles for principals and complaint signal

Search the Better Business Bureau listing for the firm's profile; accredited profiles often include "Business started on" dates and "Principal/Owner" names usable for decision-maker mapping and to gauge complaint volume and resolution cadence2.
Query local Chamber of Commerce member directory; small businesses often list the owner or branch manager contact on their profile2.



Titles variability for owner mapping on small businesses

When scraping a company's site or third-party listings, expand the title net to: Owner, Founder, Principal, Managing Member (LLC), Managing Partner (partnership), President, CEO, and Director; this aligns with common SMB owner-title patterns and helps catch variants during searches12.
Executable site search: 'site:[companydomain.com] (founder OR owner OR "managing member" OR principal OR president OR CEO OR "managing partner")'12.



Domain provenance vs. entity details

Use WHOIS on the company domain to capture domain age and registrant/admin contact. Compare domain creation date and registrant name to SoS formation date and officer names; short, private registrations paired with brand-new domains elevate risk until corroborated by SoS/licensing2.
Executable query: 'whois [companydomain.com]'.



Optional state tax entity check (when available)

Some states publish taxable-entity or franchise tax status portals (e.g., Texas) which can add an additional legitimacy signal (active vs. forfeited); incorporate where applicable, noting per-search fees when they exist2.



Risk report augmentation: add explicit phone/address fraud signals

Include reverse-lookup indicators such as: spam risk level, report counts, pickup rate trends (from Truecaller), and whether the number appears as VOIP/virtual carrier; add to "Contact reliability" and "Reputation/exposure" scoring dimensions2321.



Micro-templates for executable searches (copy/paste)

SoS officer PDFs: "[Exact Legal Name]" site:[state SoS domain] filetype:pdf2.
BBB principals: "BBB [business name] [city state]"2.
Chamber member: "[city] chamber of commerce directory [business name]"2.
Licensing (CA): "site:cslb.ca.gov [business name]" or use portal search for license number/name16.
Licensing (NYC): "site:nyc.gov buildings license [business name]" or use DOB licensee search18.
Reverse phone triangulation: run sequentially on Whitepages, Truecaller, NumLookup; flag as corroborated only when ≥2 match on person/entity name212322.



Owner title guidance for cold-call targeting

When you have an SMB but unclear top contact, prioritize roles in this order for dialing: Managing Member/Owner (LLC), President/Owner, Founder/CEO, Managing Partner, Principal; these owner-title conventions map to actual authority per common usage in small firms12.
