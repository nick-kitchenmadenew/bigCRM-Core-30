- **description**: ðŸ“Œ Executive Summary

This call focused heavily on the growing importance of AI systems like ChatGPT and Google's AI Overview for local SEO. Key discussions covered schema markup optimization for AI recommendations, citation consistency requirements, and strategic approaches to client acquisition and website management.

ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways





AI systems care more about mentions and consistent citations than traditional backlinks, making schema markup and citation accuracy critical for ChatGPT recommendations



Nested schema markup helps AI systems better understand business relationships and services, leading to more accurate recommendations



Website redesigns cause significant ranking drops - expect 3-6 months recovery time and potential client losses



URL structure matters less than internal linking for Google's understanding of site architecture



Geographic relevance content should focus on neighborhoods within your city rather than trying to rank in other cities

ðŸ“Š Main Discussion Points

Schema Markup & AI Optimization





Key points: Nested schema markup significantly improves ChatGPT recommendations



Insights: Put service schema inside local business schema to show clear relationships



Actionable tips: Use ChatGPT to create nested schema, test with Google's structured data tool, focus on FAQ schema with local language

Citation Management & Consistency





Key points: AI systems require perfectly consistent citations across all platforms



Insights: One character difference in citations can prevent AI recommendations



Actionable tips: Use Lead Snap for consistent citations ($20/month), delete old incorrect citations, ensure business name matches exactly everywhere

Website Development Strategy





Key points: Build new websites in Go High Level instead of WordPress for speed



Insights: WordPress takes much longer to develop, clients prefer faster turnaround



Actionable tips: Only use WordPress/other platforms if client already has existing site

Internal Linking & Site Structure





Key points: Keep topic silos completely separate - never cross-link between categories



Insights: Internal linking tells Google your site structure, not URL folders



Actionable tips: Link down to supporting content, link back up one level, surround links with 70-100 words of relevant content

Geographic Ranking Strategy





Key points: Very difficult to rank in cities outside your GBP address location



Insights: Better to open second location than try to overcome proximity algorithm



Actionable tips: Focus on neighborhoods within your city, create content about local landmarks and driving directions

Client Acquisition Methods





Key points: Email marketing increasingly difficult due to spam filters



Insights: Facebook/YouTube ads becoming more cost-effective than complex email setups



Actionable tips: Consider low-ticket offers ($200-300) like GBP management or website builds, use ChatGPT voice for brainstorming offers

ðŸ’¡ Notable Q&A

Q: Does URL structure matter for SEO? A: URLs are not super important. Focus on primary keywords in new URLs, but Google determines site structure from internal linking, not URL folders.

Q: Should I redesign a client's website if they're already ranking? A: Be very clear about consequences - rankings will drop to zero and take 3-6 months to recover. Many clients will fire you even when warned.

Q: How important are PBN links for indexing? A: We always use a link for every new page we publish. Budget $30 per link into your pricing structure from the start.

Q: Can businesses rank in multiple cities? A: Very difficult - proximity is a strong ranking factor. Better to get a second GBP location than try to overcome distance algorithm.

Q: How often should I post to Google Business Profile? A: Weekly is sufficient. No one reads GBP posts - they just show activity to Google.

ðŸ”® Emerging Trends & Challenges





AI-first optimization becoming more important than traditional SEO factors



Citation accuracy now critical for AI recommendations after years of being less important



Website redesigns increasingly risky as Google's algorithm becomes more established



Email marketing getting harder due to improved spam detection



Paid advertising becoming more cost-effective than complex outreach strategies



Multi-location businesses need careful strategy to avoid ranking confusion

0:03: yesterday. Um, don't want to get rid of that aspect of it. So, instead, what

0:09: we're going to do is say one, just one question. When you have your hand up,

0:14: uh, and if you have follow-up questions or want to ask more questions, go ahead, put your hand up a second time and then

0:21: when it gets over to you, we'll, um, call on you a second time. I think that went pretty well. And just to make sure,

0:29: uh, the other thing I did is if you have any questions that are, uh, chat questions that you can just put in the

0:35: chat, feel free to put those in the chat and I'll hit those in between the hands up questions so you'll get your

0:42: questions answered quicker if um, if you put it in the chat. But if you want to

0:48: raise your hand, that's fine, too, right? Just one question at a time. that way, you know, we don't have to be here

0:53: for like 5 hours and some poor person who maybe I think something happened a

0:58: couple weeks ago where some people got kicked off and then they rejoined and at the end of the queue. Anyway, all right.

1:04: So, with that in mind, let's go ahead and get started with uh with Dylan.

1:09: You there Dylan? There's Dylan,

1:16: you're muted, man. Hey, Caleb. Hey.

1:22: Um, yes. So, I had a question about the URL structure with supporting content.

1:29: Um, does it matter if you do like backs slashcategory page back slash

1:36: topic or just back slashtopic um when you're trying to push the

1:42: authority up to the specific money page? So, you're asking about the URL

1:48: structure. Yeah. Yeah, the URLs are not super important. So, if you're creating a new

1:54: URL, we'll typically go ahead and put the primary keyword in the new URL just

1:59: because why not? It's a new URL and we can do that. Uh, but beyond that, we don't really

2:04: worry about it as much. Um, having the keywords in the URL is better than not

2:10: having the keywords in the URL. Um, but at the same time,

2:16: right, if we Google cares a lot less about having keywords in the URL than

2:22: than they used to, right? So, it's helpful. I mean, why not do it if you're doing it anyway, but I would not stress

2:29: about it or make it a big deal. Um, okay. Yeah. So, does it matter if

2:37: you do like the parent child pages and all that stuff in WordPress or can you

2:42: just have like a thousand random URLs? Yeah, we don't usually do any of the

2:48: subfolders or anything like that in in the WordPress. We just have a thousand uh pages. I think we use we might use

2:55: posts. I don't even know. It doesn't matter. Uh but yeah, we just create the page, put the URL slug in there, try to

3:01: make it match the primary keyword because remember when Google is looking at your site, it's deciding your URL

3:07: structure or it's deciding your site structure not based on your URLs but based on your internal linking, right?

3:14: So it's the internal linking that's important, not the URL structure. Cool.

3:19: All right. Cool. So like the main page I want to rank for is domain slasservices

3:28: dissertation writing. Well, we'll we'll come back to you if that's okay, Dylan. Okay, sure.

3:34: Billy, how are you? Great. How you doing? Good, good, good. Hey, so just as a side note, uh do

3:42: watch your videos. Do watch your stuff. So, I uh sort of tried all the last

3:48: stuff you're talking about for chat GPT on one of my clients and I I I I went on

3:55: there and and for every secondary category, every service niche, I asked for recommendation chat GBT came up. So

4:03: then what I did, I said, "Okay, I had someone else that's not even affiliated with me. Can you please do these same searches on your chat GBT and see if

4:10: it's coming up for you, too?" And it did. So, we just did basically what you

4:15: said and Chat GBT is recommending that client for everything. That's awesome. Crazy.

4:21: Love it. Yeah. Crazy how that stuff works, huh? Uh, well, you know, um, it's not

4:27: surprisingly the recommendation engine that chat GPT uses isn't super different

4:33: from the ranking engine that Google uses. Right? Google has I've talked about this before so I'll be brief here

4:39: but Google has spent 25 years trying to figure out how they can recommend a

4:45: business to their users and we all know if you're ranked highly on Google

4:50: there's a lot of just you know trust that comes with that right if you're placed number one two three on Google

4:57: the people who are doing that search trust your business more because you're ranked highly on Google that level of trust is even stronger with chat GPT so

5:04: if you are designing a new system today and you had to figure out which

5:10: businesses to recommend to your users based on nothing except what you can find online, you'd probably end up with

5:18: a pretty similar recommendation engine to what Google has been using for 25 years because they've been spending 25

5:24: years trying to answer that same question. But, you know, you have some deficiencies in crawling that you have

5:30: to overcome. Chat GPT can't crawl as well as Google. uh and you have a lot more processing power that you can

5:36: leverage. So worse crawling, more processing power. We get into this situation where chat GPT cares more

5:42: about mentions than about links because chat GPT can't see the links. Uh and

5:47: chat GPT cares a lot more about consistent citations, right? I remember talking with SEOs years ago and they're

5:54: all saying citations are a complete waste of time and money because Google doesn't really care about them anymore.

6:00: And they were not wrong, right? The only time we use citations pretty much for years was to get a GBP verified. Once a

6:08: GBP is verified, we wouldn't use citations at all. But that's now different because chat GPT really cares

6:14: about citations. And uh all the evidence that I have seen and looked at um

6:20: personally uh looking at Google's AI overview like I thought chat GPT cared

6:25: about citations. Man, Google's AI overview seems to care about nothing except that you have perfectly

6:32: consistent citations. Like, if you want the Google AI overview to recommend you and you messed up like one minor

6:39: character on a citation, you're not going to get recommended. The AI overview cares so much about perfect

6:44: citations, it's kind of ridiculous. Anyway, thank you for saying that, Billy. I do appreciate it. Go ahead.

6:51: As a side note on that same issue is the the the schema descriptions we were

6:57: putting in we did put a website page description in the schema almost word for word was coming out on chat GBT on

7:03: all of them. It was it was and we did the same thing with the AI overview and they were

7:10: coming out in all AI overviews too but we we also had a lot of citations for this plan already before we even started

7:16: this but anyway just that's a great point. That's a great point. Just to make sure that, you know, I want to make

7:21: sure everyone hears it, right? Like the easiest way to get chat GPT to tell its

7:26: users what you want chat GPT to tell them is to put it in your schema. Uh

7:31: because again, right, I just said chat GPT is not nearly as good at at crawling as Google is. So it relies so much more

7:38: on what's in your schema. So an example similar to Billy, right, we have a personal injury attorney as a client and

7:45: they got some big settlement. I think I said this on Thursday, they got some big settlement. We put that settlement, we

7:51: nested it in their local business schema and now if you ask Chat GPT for an attorney recommendation, not only does

7:57: it recommend them, it used to recommend them. So that's not new, but now it recommends them and mentions that

8:03: settlement almost word for word what we have in the schema. So yeah, if you're

8:08: not using schema, if you're not using highquality consistent citations, uh you're going to get left behind. Those

8:15: are easy to do, right? They're they're so much easier than all the other things that we have to do for local SEO. Get

8:21: your schema right, get your citations right, and you're basically set for chat

8:27: GPT, unless you're in Houston or something that you need more than that if you're in Houston. But for most

8:32: places, get your citations, get your schema, you'll be golden. All right. What's your actual question, Billy?

8:38: Well, one more side note on this. I think it's important for everyone to hear. We we're taking this now and we're

8:45: making a case study for all everyone else. We're talking to all the new clients and all existing clients about, hey, this is why you need to do the the

8:51: the the website structure because as a side note, we we did it for this other client. Look at them. We got them on the

8:58: AI review and chat GBT. So, we're using it as for sales now going forward. Just

9:03: as a side note. Awesome. Yeah. There you go. All right. So, so I I got a new guy. I just He's a

9:11: chiropractor. He's in a medium-sized city. Uh he just left some other

9:18: practice, open his own practice. He's got a pretty big operation going. Uh uh you know, nine people there, all

9:23: different stuff going on. He has a Wix website. He's only had it up since May.

9:28: He in his main Google business category for chiropractor. Uh uh he's probably

9:34: like sixth. Uh he's he's you know he's not not in the map pack. He's probably sixth and he says, "Hey, I want to do a

9:41: rebranding. I want to do a whole new website. Uh what should I tell this

9:47: guy?" Because I I know he's going to go probably, you know, you know, he's going to lose whatever rank he does have. He

9:52: got to six somehow with what he's got. Uh what do I tell this dude? Exactly that. Right. So, uh, if he

9:59: rebrands, launches a new website, but even if he doesn't, if even he just does a So, if he launches a new website on a

10:05: new domain, he's going to start over from scratch. But even if it's launching a new website on the same domain, even

10:11: if it's a new Wix website on the same domain, he's going to lose rank position. So, you know, if the Google

10:20: Google Maps tracks how many calls you're getting, they took it off and then they put it back in. um but it's not super

10:27: accurate. But if he doesn't have a call tracking number that is unique to his

10:32: SEO, then I would just take a look at how many interactions, how many calls, how many website visits is his GBP

10:38: reporting. And then it's just having a conversation with them like, hey, last month you got this many calls uh to your

10:45: Google business profile. If you move forward with a rebrand, a redesign on

10:50: the website, I would expect that this number will go to zero in the couple of months following your redesign. Um, and

10:58: if that number is already very low, like one or two, cuz you know, depending on an average of six could be quite good,

11:04: right? He could be ranked in the top three on half of the map and then 10 plus on the other half, or he could be

11:09: number five everywhere or number six everywhere, uh, which would be invisible and no calls. So if there are zero

11:15: calls, uh then presumably since he's already sixth, you know how big his website is. You know how big some of his

11:22: competitor's websites are. Uh so you have and obviously you know how much content you're publishing in a regular

11:28: basis. So you have some idea of how long between now and when his you would

11:34: expect him to be in the top three just based on the sheer volume of content. So

11:39: yeah, so the one conversation if if he's getting calls is to say those calls are going to go away if you do this rebrand.

11:45: If you're okay with that, fine, let's do it. The second option, if he's not getting calls, is hey, we're going to

11:51: get there in 3 months, 4 months, whatever the timing is. Uh, and I would expect that to be pushed to be three or

11:57: four months longer, and it might even be closer to 6 months longer, just cuz Google hates new things if he goes

12:04: forward with that website redesign. At the end of the day, obviously, it's the client's decision. Uh, so it's just

12:10: trying to make sure he understands the downside of doing that redesign as clear

12:15: as possible. Now, don't get me wrong, if you're super clear and everything that you say happens exactly as you say it,

12:23: he's still very likely going to fire you. Um, because he's still going to

12:28: blame you for not getting calls, uh, for losing rank position, etc., etc., etc.

12:33: Uh, and at the end of the day, like you know that that's why hopefully you have more than one client, right? Like

12:39: sometimes happens like that. And um I' I've had that conversation with many clients and um maybe about half of the

12:47: time I get fired even though exactly what I warned them that would happen ended up happening. Uh so it's not all

12:54: the time, but it's pretty common because if you lose a bunch of rank position, they get pretty unhappy, which makes

12:59: sense. They're paying for SEO, right? I mean, I would be unhappy, too, if I were paying for something and then it didn't

13:05: happen. So, uh, but yeah, that's that's that's the best I can do. Just spell it

13:10: out as clear as possible. And if you fire Z anyway, then, right, just you gave it your shot. What what what else

13:16: can you do? Appreciate it. Thanks. Yeah, sure. All right. So, let's see.

13:22: Jay asks, uh, with PBN ice cream truck, where should the link go? I mean, the

13:28: link should go to the domain of the uh to the URL that you're that you just wrote that you're trying to get the link

13:33: to. So, maybe I'm not understanding that question fully. Wherever the URL is is where the link should go. If you're

13:40: asking how to structure the URL, then I truly don't care. Uh, that's a lot of

13:45: subfolders. Great. Don't care. Um, so, okay. So, where should the PBNs go?

13:52: Landing page or further down? I got you. So, usually we don't send PBN links straight to the landing page, right? So,

13:58: remember we have two different types of links uh that we're sourcing to rank a PBN or to rank a GBP. Uh so, the first

14:05: type of link, this PBN link, all we're doing with the PBN link is signaling to Google that it's not slop. Um so, we're

14:12: just trying to get that URL indexed. So, we're going to point that link at the URL. Uh the links that actually build

14:18: trust are these hyper local links. Those will go to the GBP landing page. Um, not

14:23: the PBNs, not usually. All right. So, and then Michelle, man, Michelle, you

14:29: had a lot of questions on Thursday, too. No problem. In a city that is not big, like Houston, excellent. Will schema and

14:35: citations work on their own, or do you still need one backlink per location page along with schema and citations? Ah, okay. So, I'm guessing you're

14:41: talking about SEO here. Uh, we I can't remember the last time I published a page and didn't source a link to it. So,

14:48: uh, the links are not that expensive. They're like $30 a piece. Um, I mean, I know it can add up, but build it into

14:55: what you're quoting for prices. Um, you know, with the, yes, content used to be

15:01: very expensive. Uh, now it's free, which is nice, but it's not actually free. I say it's free, uh, but it's not actually

15:08: free. Uh, it adds up. Uh, and it's still just right. I know that we have trouble

15:14: getting pages indexed if they don't have external links. So, we publish uh

15:20: content and then we source external links to them. Um, so I can't answer if you actually need the links or not

15:26: because it's been a very long time since we've done SEO uh without links. And

15:31: Jay, you're right. If you have to source links to 400 pages, it adds up. But godamn, if you have a client that you're

15:38: doing 400 pages for, they better be paying you 10 grand a month. Jesus Christ, that's a hell of a client.

15:44: That's a whale. Uh so anyway, yes. And okay, so if it's you then awesome. Then

15:49: once you're ranked, the investment on that must be massive, right? Because if you think about a business that's

15:56: ranking in the top three for like plumber Houston, right? If you're in the top three for 60 or 70% of the city of

16:03: Houston, uh you're you have a sevenf figureure business just based on your Google Maps ranking. So yeah, you might

16:10: need 400 pages and a link to each page to get there, but at the end of the day, that's $14,000. I'm not saying $14,000

16:18: isn't a lot of money, but compared to how much the leads are worth when you're ranked for plumber Houston, right? You

16:25: don't need 400 pages if you're trying to rank for plumber eclectic Alabama. Uh you need two for that. All right, Mark,

16:32: how are you doing? I'm good, man. All right, speaking of Alabama, I've got a client in in uh city

16:39: A and he's about 45 minutes away from city B. City A. City B is about four

16:45: times as large. Okay. Currently, he ranks pretty good in city A. All right.

16:50: He's one and two, one, three within, you know, probably 90 out of 133 pins. Uh we

16:56: are redoing the website. My he agreed. Agreed. Um, so he's adding a

17:05: bunch of services right now. He's HBAC. He's adding electrical. He's adding like everything you can think of. He's he's

17:12: buying other companies, putting them under one roof. My question is, would you design the website to be inclusive

17:20: of all the services, launch a GBP in city B, which is where he wants to grow

17:25: to, let city A stay with the old website until we can get city B up and running

17:30: in the website, you know, generating traffic, the GBP going, and then at that

17:35: point change the the GBP and city A. Like, what would your strategy be so that we don't screw stuff up?

17:41: Right. So, that's interesting. So, you got two competing things going on. You're adding a GBP in a second city and

17:47: he also wants to add every service he can possibly think of to get more calls and business coming in. Uh so, my first

17:54: answer is you've definitely got it right. I wouldn't do both of those things at the same time, right? You've got to pick one or the other. Um if he's

18:02: doing really well in city for that GBP topic, for that GBP primary category,

18:08: then that's a strong sign that Google trusts that website. you have enough top

18:13: topical relevance, you have enough trust for that primary category. Uh so my goal

18:21: pretty often when I'm talking with a client, I want to get them more calls as fast as possible so that they're really

18:27: happy and they want to name their firstborn son Caleb, right? That's my goal with the clients. So, the quickest

18:34: way to make that happen if he has a way to get another GBP is to keep the category the same, start the new GBP,

18:42: same category, uh, build that multilocation structure that we've talked about, and you'll find that it

18:48: should rank in city B, not super easily because city B is bigger, so it's going

18:54: to be more competitive, but it will rank in city B easier than if he started a new website in city B. Okay, so that's

19:02: probably the approach I would take just because it's going to be faster. Going the other approach of saying, okay, uh,

19:07: whatever his primary category is and we're going to add electrician to it and electrician is not semantically relevant

19:13: to his primary category. Well, the way that we would do that is we're going to

19:18: add an H2 that talks about electrician and the city on his GBP landing page.

19:25: Uh, we'll write a little bit about it just like we would handle a secondary category. We'll write a little paragraph

19:31: about it and then we'll link to an electrician category page and then we're going to build out like 50 services uh

19:39: for electrician and interlink them. Uh we will have no links from this electrician section over to the existing

19:46: section. Everything needs to be siloed off. Um but the challenge is going to be

19:51: establishing topical relevance for a second topic is going to take time,

19:56: right? uh in our experience uh for a competitive space to add new topical

20:02: relevance even if you added a 100 pages about electrician services in a day and

20:08: Google wasn't upset about that it would still often take 3 to 6 months just for

20:13: Google to I don't know realize update itself uh maybe there's a time delay

20:20: built in so that you can't topic shift domains quickly um but we've seen that

20:25: that timeline 3 to six months months happen over and over and over again. So, if you went to try to add electrician uh

20:32: to his existing business, you're probably looking at 3 to 6 months before

20:37: you have any real traction in ranking for that, assuming you even can.

20:42: Whereas, if he has a second GBP and you start cranking out content for that secondary GBP under the same topic, you

20:50: can get calls within a couple of months. Yeah. So would would you think it would

20:56: be better to leave the HBAC GBP and that HBAC website al alone and then just

21:03: create two new GBPs in city A and B for their services company that incorporates

21:08: everything? Yeah, that's been a so uh I' I've had that question before. Uh, and the answer

21:15: is that if it's the same business fundamental, if it's the same business, same address, same business name, it's

21:21: usually going to be better to add the secondary categories to the existing page and to the existing GBP, but it

21:29: still will just take time, right? Uh, because you're trying to establish topical relevance for something that is

21:35: completely new. And there's always the risk of impacting their existing

21:41: rankings, especially in the beginning, because you've confused Google and now Google is like, "Oh, is this guy HVAC?

21:47: Who's this guy electric? Like, I don't I don't I don't get it. I don't understand." And you can overcome that by building enough of a topical silo.

21:54: So, an example that I've given before, we had a client, an e-commerce website, and they sold a lot of beard oil and

22:01: then they wanted to start selling beard cream. I don't have a beard, so I didn't know this at the time, but apparently

22:06: beard oil and beard cream are very different from one another. So, they added a bunch of beard cream to their

22:12: website, and not only was he not ranking for beard cream, but beard oil rankings

22:17: plummeted. So, what we had to end up doing was rebuild topical relevance for

22:22: beard cream or for beard oil and build new topical relevance for beard cream.

22:28: Uh because once Google gets confused, you need to reestablish all that topical relevance. So if you add an electrician

22:34: and you saw I think you said HVAC if you saw HVAC drop then the solution is to publish lots of content about both HVAC

22:42: and electrician but don't interlink them like keep them completely siloed completely separate and that's a signal

22:47: to Google that you do both of those things which isn't uncommon right especially for a general contractor um

22:54: which I've also seen people take the approach hey we do HVAC electrician and now we do all these other things I'm

23:00: going to change my primary category to general contract contractor. Sure, that'll make it easier to rank for all

23:06: of these different services, but the challenge is if you're ranking well for HVAC and you change your primary

23:11: category to general contractor, you will almost certainly see a massive drop in rankings for HVAC. So, just be careful

23:17: with playing with your primary category. But that's that's how I would think about it. Um, okay. Do I need a PBN link

23:25: if the pages are already indexed? Good question. Um

23:30: boy I and again I this is my answer is going to be very similar. I don't know

23:35: uh because honestly the way we do SEO we'll publish the content and then we source a link to it. I don't wait to see

23:41: if it gets indexed on its own. We just source the link to it. When I tell a client my proposal and my pricing, I

23:48: assume we're going to source a link to every single article we publish and we

23:53: source a link to every single article we publish. So, I have no experience with trying to publish and rank content that

24:00: we're not sourcing links to. So, I I would be completely guessing if I uh tried to answer that. Um, so I won't.

24:09: Sorry. All right. Mark asks, "I added three new categories and 10 new services to my GBP last week. After 3 days of

24:16: posting new pages, I've seen some movement from 20 to 10. That's great. Even a four. As yet, I haven't added

24:22: schema to any pages or got links to the postage. to keep posting for now at the same rate for other suburbs or focus on

24:27: the 10 pages posted with the other things. So, if you have no links at all,

24:32: uh then I would 100% uh start to look at building some of those trust links,

24:38: right? Like if you're seeing that much movement from just publishing content without uh sourcing links to it, then

24:44: that's that's obviously very good and it's a sign that you were in a place that had fairly low competition. Uh

24:51: which is excellent. Uh, so what I would think about doing Oh, I'm answering Mark's question, but he's not here. I'll

24:57: let him in. Um, and Mark is here. So now I'll keep going answering his question.

25:02: And it is being recorded, Mark. So you can go and check out the recording to hear the beginning of my answer. Uh, but

25:07: good that I'm I'm glad to see it's working. Uh, the next step that I would take if that were my client and I saw

25:13: that much movement from just posting content and no links, uh, is I would look for those local, uh, strong links.

25:21: like I would join the local chambers of commerce. I would look for the you know youth sports league sponsorship for

25:27: charitable organization sponsorships because my feeling with that much movement from content and no links if

25:34: you got a couple of those powerful links you'll see a lot more movement. Uh and

25:39: yeah I mean beyond that then I would say you know just keep posting. Uh I would obviously say source a link a PBN link

25:46: to everyone. Uh I and just to be clear, I'm not saying that hoping that all of you go and buy links on the ice cream

25:51: truck shop. Like I I I don't make hardly any money on the ice cream truck. Uh I'm saying that because that's basically how

25:58: we do SEO. And I I've given you the QGP. Those are solid links if you want to use

26:03: them. I'm not trying to like make a bunch of affiliate money or anything like that here. Um now, should you post

26:10: I I would not start posting geographical based content yet. Usually we start posting geographical content when we see

26:17: 20 to 40% of the rank map in the top three. That's when we switch over to geographic content. And it sounds like

26:24: you're not quite there yet. So I wouldn't switch over there. All right. And then Brian in the GBP, I assume

26:30: you're adding electrical as additional secondary category. Yes, I believe that's what we are talking about with

26:36: Mark. Uh Guy, how are you? Well, Caleb, how are you?

26:43: Good. I brought many more drinks today so that hopefully my voice doesn't hurt. Yeah. Um

26:51: I have a few questions on geographical relevance. How you build that once you once you've filled out your topical

26:57: relevance. It just feels like I just want to make sure that we're not keyword stuffing with the city, state name, and

27:05: what what do you usually how do you usually structure relevant content on your website that

27:12: Google will pick up as hey this is new, this is interesting, worth indexing, and it's geographically re relevant to you

27:19: know to improve your ranking in neighborhoods and others. That's there's a little confusion on my part for that.

27:26: Right. So, I'll show you. Um,

27:35: so this is what it looks like.

27:41: Boom. All right. So, uh, this URL, uh, if we came into

27:47: resources, nope, it's not there. It's down here. Uh, locations link on the footer takes us here. Uh

27:56: this is the wrong way to do it. This is what the prior SEO agency did. We didn't

28:01: do this. This is wrong. Uh this is the correct way to do it and this is what we did. Now Chicago, obviously we're lucky

28:06: in this in that Chicago is a very neighborhoodheavy city. Uh so there's tons of neighborhoods in Chicago. So we

28:13: can write about all of these different neighborhoods. If you're in a city that isn't as neighborh as Chicago, and I'd

28:19: be surprised if you weren't, uh, then just find other geographical markers. But what's interesting about this, so if

28:25: I open up like Rogers Park, you can see the title tag is primary category, uh,

28:32: geographic center, and then the brand, right? So we have Lasic Eye Surgery, and then the geographic center. Uh, and we

28:40: still talk about the city name. uh we talk about the uh owner, the business

28:46: owner, and then we just talk about why you might be wanting to drive from

28:52: Rogers Park to this client with embedded driving directions. Uh and we yeah, just

28:58: I mean, again, this is geographic relevance we're trying to build. So, we talk about, hey, if you're getting your

29:04: eye surgery done at this particular place, you can stay at the Palmer House. Uh you can eat at the gauge. Yum, yum,

29:10: yum. I've eaten there. decent. Uh, so anyway, does that does that help? I mean, I know that seems kind of silly,

29:15: but we just basically do that. Okay. And so it's just a neighborhood page, not a

29:21: city page. Uh, you know, other cities where you can't really rank in high competition anyways.

29:28: Yeah. But we're still going to talk quite a bit about the primary city. We talked about Chicago there quite a bit.

29:33: Yeah, absolutely. So, and yeah, keyword stuffing, I mean, that's really a thing of the past. I haven't had issues with

29:40: keyword stuffing in in a while. Uh because remember, right, when we talk about keyword cannibalization or

29:46: duplicate content or any concerns like that, we're forgetting what we're actually trying to do, right? We're not

29:53: trying to rank these individual pages. I don't care about that. I'm not tracking the organic rankings. So I if they're

29:59: ranking or not, I don't care. I'm not even looking at it. I'm using all of this content to rank the GBP. So that's why I don't care

30:06: about cannibalization. I don't care about duplicate. I don't care about stuffing. Everything I'm doing is to

30:12: rank the GBP. I don't care about the individual URLs. All I care about is that they get indexed. That's it.

30:18: Okay. So when I talk about the Google Search Console, most of the time the biggest thing that we're using the Search

30:24: Console for is uh what does the index report look like? Um, all the other

30:30: stuff in the search console incredibly valuable for non-local SEO, but none of

30:36: the Google Maps stuff is reported in the search console. So, that's a lot less valuable for local SEO,

30:43: but you Okay. Yeah, I'll I'll ask another question later. Okay. So, which frequency is fine to

30:49: post in the GBP? Should we do daily or weekly? We do weekly. Daily is a lot. Um, no one reads them. So, I mean, you

30:56: can do whatever you want. No one reads the GVP posts. Uh they're just to show activity. We just do weekly. Uh we don't

31:03: we don't lose our minds with daily posts or anything like that. Kyle, how are you doing, man?

31:10: Man, how's it going? Can you hear me? Okay. Yep. Yep. Awesome. So, I just wanted to do a quick

31:16: verification on schemas, um all the types and where to apply. I know we've talked about a couple times, but

31:21: sometimes it's easy to get confused. So I drop in the chat here. Uh what I am tracking.

31:29: Um so the local business only goes to the GBP landing page, right? Nowhere else only that one. Uh organization and

31:36: website schemas. Those are going to be the same across all pages. So include them on all but it's not like I'm making a unique organization or unique website

31:43: schema for different pages. It's just one copy and paste across all pages. For the service page, you're putting them on

31:48: all pages, but it is unique to the GP category or service. Correct. Yeah.

31:54: Yeah. And then the FAQ is TBD, right? Like if you have FAQs, include it. If not, then don't. Exactly. Okay. So, this

32:01: is all correct. Um, are there any other schemas that you use? Especially you're talking about for um chat GPT,

32:08: right? Like where you host and all that. Awesome question. So, the FAQ schema will almost always have an FAQ section

32:14: on the GBP landing page. Um, I can't remember the last time we did a GBP landing page without an FAQ section. Uh

32:21: it's just such an easy way to get some good information in there. U

32:27: so we'll almost always have FAQ schema on the GBP landing page because we'll have an FAQ there. Other FAQs are going

32:33: to be based on how much topical relevance we need. uh the service schema we'll also put on the uh GVP landing

32:41: page and we'll nest it inside the local business schema and then you nest it within it

32:47: within yeah we'll nest the service schema inside the local business schema um and I mentioned the attorney with

32:54: that uh big settlement that they had we nested that inside the local business

33:01: schema uh and I think it was is a reward reward or something like that which I'd

33:06: never used before. Uh but it was reward schema that we nested under the local business schema. So the way we came up

33:13: with that, right, I'm not that good at schema to have come up with that on my own. Um

33:20: they just had this big settlement. So I asked Chat GPT uh hey recommend an attorney in this town. And they

33:25: recommended him and I was like hey did you hear about this settlement? And Chat GPT was like no I sure didn't. Uh so I

33:31: was like okay well they had this settlement and I want you to talk about this settlement when people ask for this

33:36: attorney recommendation uh what you know I want to so I want to put the settlement in the existing

33:43: schema. So I grabbed the existing schema from the website. I gave it to chat GPT and I said edit the schema to add in

33:51: that information about the settlement. And then chat GPT uh nested in that reward schema. I checked it with the

33:57: Google structured data testing tool. it all came up roses. So then I implemented that new schema couple weeks later uh

34:04: with a new account. Obviously chatgbt learns how you who you are. So you need to either use a prompt to try to get it

34:11: to forget who you are or you need to just use a different account uh different device uh ask for an attorney

34:17: recommendation and not only did it recommend the attorney, it mentioned that settlement. So if there is

34:22: something that you want your client or that your client wants in particular to be called out, just tell chat GPT that

34:30: that's what your goal is and ask it how to implement that in the schema to make that happen. A really good thing that

34:37: we've started to do to help build that FAQ section to be even better. Um, and I

34:45: don't have this prompt yet in the pro community because I just released it. Uh, and by the way, any of you who don't

34:51: have access to the AI SEO mastery with Caleb Bulku, super creative name, I know. Uh, send me a message and I can

34:58: get you access to that since you're in pro. Um, if you're paying for both, then you can stop paying for the AI SEO

35:04: mastery with Calebu and then I'll reinvite you. So, you don't need to pay for both. But anyway, um, the prompt I'm

35:11: looking for is this one. Yes. So, I'll drop this link in the chat and it's basically a prompt that says, "Hey, chat

35:18: GPT, go crawl Red, go call Trust Pilot, go call go crawl Google reviews and tell

35:24: me what issues people are having for this service provider in this local

35:30: area." And then uh ChatGpt will end up recommending some questions based on

35:36: what people are actually talking about in that area for that service provider. Right? Like if you have an uh HVAC tech

35:44: in Miami, you don't want an FAQ about furnaces, right? But you do want an FAQ

35:51: about furnaces if your HVAC tech is in Minneapolis. So Chat GPT will help you by crawling those subreddits of the

35:58: relevant cities and the subreddits of the relevant industries and all of that. And then you can write your FAQ

36:05: using the language that people are using when they're talking about that type of business in that region.

36:11: And then when you create your FAQ schema, you're going to repeat it and use the again the same language that

36:17: people are using when they're talking about that region, about that service, because that's how people talk to chat

36:22: GPT. And the closer your stuff matches what people are prompting chat GPT, the

36:28: more likely chat GPT is to just regurgitate the answers that you've put in your schema. Okay. So anyway, I like

36:35: that prompt. It's worked really well at uh yeah putting very relevant, very

36:41: local uh questions on the GBP landing page that we then call out with FAQ

36:47: schema. Makes sense. Thanks, man. Um you mentioned nesting. Um I feel like we

36:52: haven't talked about that a lot. Are you also nesting like your service schema and like your org schema on nonLBS

36:58: landing pages? Like it's really landing page. Yeah. schema beyond the GB like so the GBP landing

37:04: page is obviously like if I had to assign an importance out of a 100 points

37:09: the GBP landing page would get like 90 and then the other 10 points would be spread among the rest of the site the

37:16: rest of the domain um so the only URLs that we do fancy schema for is the GBP landing page

37:25: makes sense um at the risk of asking a follow-up question I'll I may follow up

37:30: with some more like theoretical questions on all this schema stuff, man. Especially since you're saying it's so important for chat, but um I see other

37:36: hands, so I will yield the floor now. All right. And Heinrich asks, "How much service schema do you nest in the local

37:42: business schema? All 30 or 40." No, we're going to nest the categories and services that we link to from the GBP

37:49: landing page. So, I'm not going to nest in every single service on the website or that's on the GBP. I'm going to nest

37:57: in the services that we link to from the GBP landing page. And then when we get to the category pages, I'm going to nest

38:03: in the services that are underneath that category on the GBP. So eventually we'll

38:09: have them all, but we'll match the GBP structure, right? Okay, cool. Davidid,

38:14: am I saying that right? Is it Davidid? Hello, Calb. Yes. Uh, yes. Uh, perfect.

38:20: French. I'm not French. No, you don't speak French. Yeah, because you pronounce the French way. So that's

38:26: fine. Um so I have a question about internal linking and silo.

38:32: Perfect. Yes. Uh so you you already talked about that but just to be sure uh you never never link silo together even

38:40: if there is um some some service that's sharing silo like I

38:46: have this optometrist or I have other example like there is something I think for

38:52: me control prolicing eyes visual screening and lenses and they are

38:58: related together but they are they are in different category so in that case I mean You never link silo together.

39:06: We don't link silos together. I mean, never is a tough word to use. Um, but

39:11: when we're like doing the internal linking and everything, we know the page

39:16: that we're creating, we know what category it sits under on the GBP. So, we're going to have it sit under the

39:21: same category on the website. And then, you know, we're not going to link across categories. Even if the categories are

39:28: something like plastic surgeon and cosmetic surgeon, we still don't link across category. Uh that siloed

39:34: structure to build topical relevance is very powerful. It works really well and as soon as we start cross-linking, it

39:41: starts to not be nearly as effective. Um so yeah, I mean even if I mean I can't

39:48: even think of a situation where a user would find value in a cross-linking like that because you know and you'll see

39:54: this if you install Google Analytics. No one is reading all of this content, right? All of this content is for

40:00: Google's algorithm. Um, so yeah. Anyway,

40:05: okay. So, it's bad bad practice to I mean, you never do that. We don't do that. Yeah. It's not that's not part of what

40:11: we do. Uh, yeah, that's just question about the the internal linking of silo. Is it a problem that uh

40:19: uh is there rules about the number of links and the the position in the paragraph? Like if you have the three

40:26: first paragraph was links, it's uh it's wrong or should be should we skip? We want to put the links in as plain

40:32: text and we want the links to be surrounded by content about the topic of the page we're linking to. So, usually

40:39: when we we'll do internal links, we're going to uh put like an H2 for the

40:44: services below the category and then we'll put 70 100 words under that H2 and

40:50: we'll link to the category page in that paragraph under the H2 so that all of the content around that link is about

40:57: the page we're linking to. And we'll do the same thing when we start to do supporting content if we need it. uh we

41:03: find supporting content with the people also ask questions and then we're we'll create an FAQ and we'll link to the

41:10: deeper answer from the FAQ section. So we're not just putting links everywhere uh in the site. The links are almost

41:17: always in a paragraph that talks about whatever topic of the page we're linking to.

41:23: So you never put two links in one paragraph in the same paragraph? Not usually. No.

41:30: Okay. I mean, we might depending on what's happening. I mean, that's not like a a rule, but usually we wouldn't

41:36: because we usually don't need to. Um, Brian, how are you? Good to see you again. Been a minute.

41:43: Good to see you, too. Yeah, I know. It's uh I had come back from life work working way too much. Um, save the

41:49: story, though. So, I have like five new questions that popped up just by

41:54: listening to all the conversations here, but I'll stick to the original ones since I know it's like you can get lost

42:00: in the questions. Um, I apologize for the redundancy here, but no worries. Going back to again, I'm still stuck on

42:07: client acquisition. So, I know a lot of these guys are already like at the the point where they're um acquiring the

42:14: clients, but going back to like the email strategy. So, because I had reached out to the guy

42:20: you had recommended a while ago, and he looked at me like I was nuts when I had mentioned I'm doing looms and doing it

42:25: that way. He was like, "Why are you doing that?" He's like, "Oh, well, you can do that, but you know, it's going to

42:30: be really hard." And I'm like, "It's what Caleb recommended. So, what do you know?" So, long story short, it kind of

42:37: sort of worked for Outlook, but I was never able to get past I would get in the inbox, but the gifts would just

42:42: never display. Um, for Google, I was able to. So now I've gotten to a point

42:48: where now Google I can't even get the gifts to display. I have to do just a static image. So I don't know if they've

42:54: updated their the restrictions on the spam filters, but like so my all this to be said, long

43:01: story short, my question to you is I know you you're kind of hands off with it. Do you is your team still utilizing

43:07: that that GIF strategy for email or have they gone another direction?

43:14: Yeah, good question. So, no is the short answer of it. Um, managing the emails uh

43:22: to get it. Okay. So, I'm going to So, I have the YouTube channel and I get quite

43:28: a few local SEO leads coming in from that. Uh, so if you have a year or so

43:35: before you actually need a client, I would highly recommend a YouTube channel.

43:41: But it does take like a year before it starts to work. That's my caveat. And the downside is there are few things

43:48: that you can do that are a bigger waste of time than a YouTube channel for six months and then give up because it's not

43:54: working. Uh then you would have just wasted 6 months, right? Uh and I think I've said this before, but it's probably

44:00: it was probably like 6 to9 months before anyone watched my YouTube videos other than my editor and my mom, right? So, uh

44:08: that's where most of my clients come from now. So, yeah, we don't deal with the email stuff and and things like

44:13: that. Now, and I' I've mentioned this before, uh before the end of August is my goal. I'm going to make this happen.

44:20: I'm going to start the challenge where I build an SEO agency to 10K in 3 months

44:26: without any sales calls. Um, and I've I've uh built my agency with Upwork.

44:33: Upwork takes too long to do that in 3 months. Uh, so I'm not going to try it on Upwork. Um, I'm not going to try it

44:40: with cold email because cold email it works, right? Uh, but the response rates

44:46: are pretty similar to Upwork. Like even if your cold email is absolutely perfect and flawless, you're probably looking at

44:52: like a two to 3% response rate. So, if you're sending 10, 15, 20 a day, then

44:59: you're going to have a couple of conversations a month, which will work, but it's going to take time. So the way

45:05: to scale that is you need to send more messages every day. So a 100 a day or

45:11: 150 a day. But if you send that many cold emails with a single domain, you're going to burn the domain. So now you

45:17: need 10 different domains to send emails from each one and you need to warm them

45:22: all up and it just ends up being this like you you I'd end up needing an employee just to manage all this email

45:30: stuff going on in order to make all that happen. Uh, and when you when I start to

45:36: add up the cost for what does it cost to use all the email tools, uh, to get the

45:41: domains ready, to have an employee who can do all of this and manage all of it, uh, it very quickly starts to become

45:48: cost competitive with Jesus, I'm just going to run Facebook ads and YouTube ads, right? So, my plan for the 10K

45:56: challenge is I'm going to do it with Facebook ads and YouTube ads, right? Because if you have a good offer,

46:02: uh you can get good leads for five to 10 bucks a piece with Facebook Google ads.

46:09: Uh sometimes even less if you have a really good offer. Now, if your offer is

46:14: we'll do SEO for $1,000 a month, you're not going to get any leads because that's a really shitty offer, right? So,

46:20: you need to have a good offer that attracts the person you're talking to. So, that's the first step is who are you

46:26: talking to with this ad, right? And once you think about that, then okay, what do they want? What challenges have they

46:33: had? And how can you craft a message that really resonates with them? And this conversation, like I love chat

46:40: GPT's voice uh for this exact reason. I'll uh put my headphones on, I'll load

46:46: up Chat GPT, hit the voice, and then just have a brainstorming session with it about stuff like this. It doesn't

46:53: matter if you interrupt it. uh it usually does a good job at answering your questions. Uh so yeah, um chat GPT

47:00: voice uh is what I've used to help to define some of these offers and things like that. Um so because you're not

47:09: doing like the additional caveat on my challenge of no sales calls basically

47:14: means that I need to be coming in the door with a low ticket offer, right? I'm not going to convince someone to give me

47:20: $3,000 a month without a sales call. that would be ridiculous for cold traffic. Uh so I'm coming up with a cold

47:27: offer uh that I'm going to be able to run, hopefully scale it to the 10K with adding on uh upsells once they see that

47:35: we can actually execute the low ticket offer. Uh but beyond that, assuming you're okay with the sales call, it

47:42: becomes a lot easier uh to either lead with a low ticket offer or come in and

47:48: try to go straight for the high ticket offer. So, some low ticket offers that I know have been working really well for

47:54: people are things like a website buildout cuz you can do a full website buildout for 300 bucks, right? Uh

48:01: homepage, couple of category pages, about page cost you $1, $150. That's a

48:07: 50% profit margin minus of course your ad costs. But for a lot of these low ticket offers, you're really hoping to

48:13: break even on ad costs and then make your money on the upsells. Uh, another good one is going to be something like

48:19: GBP management where you take care of their weekly GBP posts. Uh, you respond

48:25: to all the GBP reviews. Uh, you make sure their GBP citations are all set up correctly and everything looks good. And

48:32: that's something that you can charge 200 bucks a month for. And your cost to provide those services would be

48:37: something like $26 a month, right? Because with Lead Snap, it's 60 bucks

48:42: for 10 GBPs, uh, plus $20 a piece for citations. So, that works out to $26 per

48:48: GBP. And Lead Snap will do all of the posts, uh, all the review responses, all

48:54: of that jazz uh, with AI. Uh, you can also add a reputational management uh,

49:00: on top of that where you actually try to get them additional reviews if they have a customer list, stuff like that. So,

49:06: uh, I'm not trying to dissuade you from email. Like I know it works and I know it can work, but it's just a little slow

49:13: um because of the relatively low response rate. I don't know. Is that helpful,

49:19: Brian? I just started talking. Yeah. No, no, no. um that that was going

49:25: to be the next step was going to start utilizing the Facebook ads because um

49:30: I've hit a lot of headaches with the email because email especially using like Loom or having to go to now image

49:36: because now we can't even send GIFs anymore without it getting blocked in spam and this is with like

49:42: meticulous warm-up. Um yeah, I've kind of gotten to that point where I'm ready to start using ads. But yeah,

49:48: I believe it. For a long time, I was working on putting together an email course that I was going to add to the classroom. And uh whenever we tried to

49:56: do it with email, it just it was just so freaking difficult and almost as

50:01: expensive per lead as like, god damn it, I'm just going to run ads. Uh so yeah.

50:07: Um cool. So yeah, so guy said plain text works best

50:12: and yeah, that's obviously correct. plain text is going to get into the inbox a lot more easily, but you're

50:19: going to get a much lower response rate than if you can actually get an image or a video in there. Uh, okay. Do map

50:26: citations help in getting rank in neighborhoods that are 5 to 10 miles away from the business location? Uh, do

50:31: map citations help? So, it depends on what you mean by citations, right? So, when I think of citations, I think of

50:37: two different kinds of citations. Uh, I think of the spammy citations from like

50:43: 2019 where you could point a VA to a directory list and they would type your

50:48: business information in until their fingers are bleeding. Uh, those citations don't do anything. They're a

50:54: waste of time. Um, high quality citations, typically citations that require verification,

51:01: those are impactful uh in improving your rank position. So, I talked about lead

51:07: snap. That's the tool we use to get these citations. 20 bucks a month. Uh Apple Maps, Bing, Bing for Business, uh

51:14: a bunch of navigation systems, etc., etc. All right. If you're sending links and looms, you're going to ruin it.

51:19: Yeah, Mark. Same same thing that we've talked about. Uh the goal with all of that was to try to get responses uh to

51:26: improve the response rate versus just plain text. Uh but yeah, that's email is

51:31: email is tough. All right. And Brian, [Music] some more questions. Boy, I'll get back

51:38: to these. Let's go to Billy. How are you? Great. Great. So, am I correct in

51:43: understanding that you're when you when you start making new websites for people now, it's

51:49: all go high level. That's all you're doing or you're also doing WordPress too because we've made some we started off

51:55: making WordPress websites and they're beautiful, but they take so much longer than go high level. So, I'm sort of

52:02: wondering what you're doing. If someone comes in and say, "Hey, they want a new website." What do you do? they want a new website, we're almost

52:08: always just going to build it in high level. Uh the only time we're going to work with WordPress or Web Flow or Wix

52:15: or Weebly or whatever is if they already have a website on that platform, then we'll just work with their existing

52:21: website. Uh if they're building a brand new website and they don't care, we're usually just going to build it in high

52:27: level. Yeah. Great. Perfect. Thank you. Awesome. Nadem, what's going on, man?

52:34: How's it going, Caleb? You okay? Yeah, doing good. What? Um, okay. So, I was speaking to Well, he

52:41: was a potential client. I've actually landed him now due to start on the 1 of October.

52:47: His competition is about 60 60 URLs. And um he um so he ain't got much money. So,

52:53: I just said, "Look, 68 685 for five URLs a month." Um I told him, "Look, it's

53:00: going to take us a year to get to get it up and going basically." Um and he's okay with that. So, um it was just to

53:07: get it in. He his GMBB got he he changed his address on his GMBB and he got suspended. Um he's emailed him, done

53:15: everything he can, well, everything he says he can. He's had no response from them. So, I don't know whether he's

53:21: maybe emailed them the wrong email or I don't know. But what I did is because where the the offer is actually starting

53:27: on the 1st of October, he's paid me half the fee already just to confirm it. But what I did is um I said, "Look, I'll do

53:35: a little bit of time of trying to get it back up and running for you. And I'll do it as a little freebie." And I just done that cuz I thought, right, I haven't

53:41: dealt with this before where it's been suspended. So it' be good for a bit of training and also just to keep him in

53:47: line for that 1st of October. Um what do you recommend to do? He's got like he's

53:53: got about 30 reviews on there, so you don't really want to lose it. No. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um,

54:01: so so usually uh during a suspension then

54:08: we'll just appeal the suspension and we'll just provide the documentation, the paperwork that proves uh the

54:15: business name is correct, the business address is correct, the phone number is correct, and the owner's name is correct. Uh so uh business formation

54:23: paperwork, a lease agreement, utility statements, insurance statements, anything like that, we um we will

54:30: typically do uh for a suspension. You get two chances to

54:36: appeal the suspension. If you get denied the second time, then you're basically done. Uh it often will take Google,

54:42: sometimes they'll respond in 24 hours and sometimes they'll respond in 3 weeks. uh you're really just up to

54:48: Google's timeline for what to do assuming that you've submitted the appeal correctly. Uh it's just yeah a

54:55: lot of waiting time basically. And where do you go to make that appeal then? Where what is there a link you've

55:01: got you could give me? How do I make that appeal? So I can't give you the link. It's a

55:06: link that uh appears on the back end of the GBP. Um,

55:14: so yeah,

55:21: prepare the evidence. Yeah. So, open the Google Well, you know, I'll just send you this. So, it's a support document.

55:27: And here it does give you the link for the Google business profile appeals tool. Uh, sign into the account and then

55:34: select the one you want to appeal and submit appeal with all of the evidence.

55:39: Do that one. get access to his GMBB. Can I still get access to his GMBB even though it's been appealed and even

55:44: though it's can't then he can submit the appeal himself. Okay. Okay. Um cuz what I did is I sent

55:50: him a video of how to with my you know the organization ID to send it to him so

55:56: to get me access but um but we'll see if I if if it does let me.

56:01: Perfect. Good luck. So link and post. You mentioned for the locally relevant pages to add a link.

56:07: Uh, I'm assuming that's indexing. Pros and cons, is it better to So, yeah. So, this is Brian's question. He's asking,

56:13: "Do I really need to put a link in?" I'll give the same answer I did earlier in the call. Uh, we always put a link

56:19: in. Uh, we budget it when we land a client that we're going to do a link for every URL. So, we just do a link for

56:25: every URL. I didn't catch right versus wrong way when you pulled up the website referring to the uh I don't know if I

56:31: talked about Oh, oh, oh. Right versus wrong way. That's right. So, when I pulled up the uh website to show the

56:37: location data, good catch, Brian, I didn't talk about this. Uh I showed the top of it and said, "This is the wrong

56:43: way to do it. This is what the prior agency did." And then I showed what we did. The difference was the stuff the

56:49: prior agency did was a bunch of cities in the Chicagoland area. Uh whereas what

56:55: we did was a bunch of neighborhoods inside the city of Chicago. So remember that it's very hard to rank your GBP in

57:02: a city other than the city that the GBP address is located in. So if your GBP

57:08: address is Chicago, it's going to be almost impossible to rank in Neapville. So we don't need to publish content

57:14: about Neapville to try to rank there. Usually people are doing the opposite where they have a landscaping business

57:19: in Neapville and they want to rank in Chicago. Still going to be very difficult. Okay. Uh nested. When I talk

57:26: about nested schema, I mean putting multi a different type of schema inside the other type of schema. Uh no schema

57:33: generating tool that I know of is capable of generating nested schema for you. So usually what we'll do is we'll

57:39: use one of the schema generating tools and then we'll give that schema to chat

57:44: GPT and ask it to do the nested schema and add the additional types inside that

57:50: type of schema. And by silo we mean yes that is what we mean by silo Brian. All

57:56: right. Now let's see. Daniel, I have a client, a specialized dental practice ranking well locally. Chicago

58:02: competitors are ranking in Milwaukee and my client wants to rank in Chicago. What's the strategy? Uh so you're

58:08: probably not going to want to hear, but usually the strategy uh is going to be

58:13: to get another GBP. Um, if the Chicago ones are ranking in in Milwaukee, then

58:21: that's just a sign that they have an insane amount of relevance and trust.

58:27: Um, so to rank Milwaukee in Chicago, you're going to need to overcome all of

58:32: the Chicago dentists uh, relevance and trust plus an order of magnitude higher

58:39: than all of their trust and relevance because you need to overcome the proximity. Uh, so the very short answer,

58:45: Daniel, is I would say it is not a reasonable goal for your Milwaukee dentist to rank in Chicago. It will be

58:53: most likely less expensive for them to open a second dental office in Chicago

58:59: versus trying to outrank the Chicago dentists. Um, and yeah, we see it happen

59:04: every once in a while where the GBP will rank in a different city, but it's rare because of how hard it is. All right,

59:11: guy. what you got? Oh, just to follow up on the

59:17: what I don't want to do is set myself up for failure of, you know, set too high of expectations on what's really

59:24: difficult to do and what's a lot simpler to do. And it just it seems like the

59:30: really extremely difficult ones are the you know the the cities that are like a million three plus in the US.

59:36: Yeah. And then like very difficult would be like between 300k and a million three

59:42: uh you know your um and and I don't know what what's your

59:48: just general experience um on difficulty of rank with a when within a similar

59:54: industry like a home services business for example um you know landscapers or

1:00:01: um HVAC. Well, so it's tough to say, right? Because different cities are

1:00:08: frankly different cities, right? So you might find a city that, you know, has a

1:00:14: couple hundred thousand people, but three businesses in that area decided they really want to invest in SEO. So

1:00:20: the competition is what you might expect to see in a million population city

1:00:26: instead of a 100,000. Uh, I can't remember what the niche was, what the

1:00:32: service area was, but I was looking at Fort Wayne, Indiana, one of my favorite cities just to look at randomly. Uh, and

1:00:39: all three of the ones ranking in the maps had like three, four, 500 URLs

1:00:44: indexed, which is insane for a city with a population of Fort Wayne, Indiana. Um,

1:00:52: so we don't like I don't have general guidelines. It really is, you know, just based on what the other businesses in

1:00:58: that city have done because the sample set of winners uh is so small. It's only three, right?

1:01:07: Is so small that when we talk about competition, we're not talking about

1:01:12: average or median, right? We're talking about being one of the top three. So,

1:01:17: one crazy guy who just loses his mind with SEO can actually tilt the

1:01:24: competitiveness of that entire region to being way more competitive than you might expect to see it uh for the

1:01:30: population for that type of business, right? And an example that I give, one of the very first SEO clients that I

1:01:37: ever landed was a carpet cleaner in Mobile, Alabama. And man, it was so hard

1:01:45: to rank it. Like, we ended up building so much content and so many links to rank this website that this carpet

1:01:52: cleaning website had an AHF's domain rating of like 45 by the time it was

1:01:58: finally ranked in the top three. And this is a carpet cleaning, a business where each call is worth like 30 bucks

1:02:05: or 40 bucks or some miserable amount like that, right? So, um I I know I have

1:02:12: a lesson in the training where I go through like check the sizes and that that's how we judge competitiveness.

1:02:19: Basically, that's just what we do every time we're looking at a new client is how big are the sites that are ranking,

1:02:24: how big is your site? Uh if their site is a similar if if the sites that are ranking are several hundred URLs, um

1:02:32: then that's a sign of obviously very high competition and uh our our proposal is going to be quite expensive. um if we

1:02:40: see that there's several hundred URLs in the uh website that is reached out. So

1:02:46: if their website is a similar size or larger but just ranked terribly

1:02:53: um then we often will take the approach of

1:02:58: adding a technical audit. Um like so we have this plastic surgeon in uh New York

1:03:05: City uh 600 URLs indexed but his rank position on his in his lobby if you

1:03:13: search for plastic surgeon New York in his lobby he would be ranked 20th. Um so

1:03:18: there's obviously something else wrong with the website. So we just add a technical audit uh to our normal client

1:03:25: package when something like that comes up. And that technical audit is something that we do with a combination

1:03:31: of AI screaming frog and an employee of mine who manually does it. I think we

1:03:37: have that on the you do have that in the in the training. Yeah. So, so it's it's really a function

1:03:43: of, you know, do the site the site analysis of their top three and kind of

1:03:49: be at or above the median and that's a good starter point and then you just budget off of required articles to rank

1:03:57: essentially. Exactly. And and you know it's probably there's probably a general relationship by

1:04:03: population size, but it's not a perfect predictor. it's not a strong enough one

1:04:08: that I'm not going to check the size of their local competitors before I, you

1:04:14: know, give a proposal with the number in it. U and that's one of the things that I actually really like about Lead Snap's

1:04:20: local rank maps versus what we used to use local dominator. Uh because when you run the local rank map with Lead Snap,

1:04:27: it gives you the business that you ran and gives their rank map, but it also gives all of the businesses in that

1:04:33: region and you can pull up any rank map you want. you can pull up their website. It makes it very fast, very easy uh to

1:04:40: quickly check and everyone you can look at and you can see how everybody ranks in the same area

1:04:46: and um and then yeah like how many the percentage of dots where they're on the

1:04:51: podium and stuff like that. It's it's pretty cool. So um so so just a quick

1:04:58: let's just say the top three the the number two person or number two firm has

1:05:05: 40 articles. So you it's like a core 40 you'd be able to match or slightly be

1:05:11: higher than that and you would be in a good position to um do that within a a two to three month

1:05:17: period. Is that is that being presumptive or is that you know that's also well so if if they have like

1:05:24: 30 pages and they're ranking okay but not great and their competitors who are ranking great have like 50 or 60 pages

1:05:31: then it's just like all right well we're going to need 20 or 30 pages. Uh let me assume it's a six-month timeline uh or a

1:05:39: three-month timeline whatever the budget the client has. So then, okay, we're going to do 30 pages a month or we're

1:05:44: going to do 15 pages a month depending on whatever the math works out to. And then what is my cost per page? And boom,

1:05:52: that's what I'm going to send them over. Cool. All right. We uh used to spend a lot more time

1:05:57: putting proposals together, but I'm sure a lot of you have also learned the hard way that most proposals uh you get

1:06:04: crickets back. So now we uh just crank them out quickly, and if we're wrong, we'll figure it out later. Um, all

1:06:10: right, Kyle, what's what you got?

1:06:15: All right, man. Uh, you brought up this whole nesting thing and it's got my brain spinning because I feel like we haven't talked about this topic. So,

1:06:21: just theoretically, like what is the advantage of nesting versus not? Like obviously you're doing it so it matters.

1:06:28: So, like just if I were to like take it up a you know not tactical level like why why do I care? Why does the

1:06:34: algorithm care about it? like or what resources can I look at to start learning more just about this because I

1:06:39: feel like this is just new for me. Yeah, that's an interesting question. Right. So, uh I don't have

1:06:46: so this is not something that we have split tested is I guess the way that phrasing it. Um

1:06:52: so don't hold you to it. Well, but the reason we started doing it is

1:06:57: uh the way that the that the AI like looks at code or reads things. So, we

1:07:04: have this overall category. We're going to say local business. And then we're going to say everything about that local business and the regular local business

1:07:10: schema. Then we're going to say, hey, we also have these services. But I want the AI to know that those services are

1:07:17: offered by that local business. So, I'm going to put the service schema inside the local business schema just to be

1:07:24: super clear that that business does those services. And that's why when I talk about like that reward schema for

1:07:30: the settlement and then put that inside the local business schema which you know was an attorney schema here uh to again

1:07:38: like the LLMs the a the generative AI whatever you want to call them they're

1:07:44: so like logical they have to be in terms of how they look at things. So I want to

1:07:49: put everything inside the local business schema so that that AI looks at it and

1:07:55: says okay all of this stuff is inside the local business schema therefore it must be that business to that does it.

1:08:02: Now like I said I haven't split tested it where I haven't done a bunch of schema and not done it nested. So I

1:08:08: can't tell you that nesting it is super important or anything like that. Uh all we can all I can say is that when we did

1:08:14: nest it we started to get chat GPT to basically repeat exactly what we were putting in the schema. So it's like cool

1:08:20: that works. Moving on. Um and there's no reason not to right and you it's just you know chat GPT can

1:08:28: write schema for you and can write that schema nested if you ask for it. Sir okay so it sounds like the rationale

1:08:35: is less for GMA's algorithm ranking and more so for chatbt and its output. Is

1:08:40: that correct? 100%. It is almost zero for Google Maps ranking.

1:08:46: Got it. Okay, that uh that answers my question. Makes sense. Thank you.

1:08:51: Yeah, absolutely. Awesome. All right. Guy asked, "Is there downside to getting a client to file a DBA optimized for

1:08:57: geographical relevance?" Smith Plumbing of Houston. So, if you're going to put geographical relevance in the GBP name,

1:09:03: you do really should have a DBA. Um just because you're likely going to get

1:09:09: suspended. uh competitors going to report it, something like that. Now,

1:09:14: that being said, even if you do it, you still can get suspended, but then you have your DBA, so you can get the

1:09:20: suspended suspension lifted. We don't typically do that with uh the GBP

1:09:28: optimized for relevance. We don't put keywords in the GBP title. We used to um it used to be really effective and

1:09:34: honestly, it still is. If your only goal is ranking in Google Maps, putting keywords in your business title will get

1:09:40: you ranked in Google Maps faster uh with the risk of suspensions. Um but if

1:09:46: you're okay with that risk, knock yourself out. The challenge is uh remember the way that the AI overview

1:09:53: and chat GPT works is they're looking for mentions of your business to decide

1:09:58: whether or not to recommend your business, right? So, a Google business profile is nothing more than a citation

1:10:06: for chat GPT. Uh, and it's less important than Bing for business, which is the one that chat GPT has easier

1:10:12: access to thanks to the Microsoft partnership. So, my concern would be,

1:10:17: uh, and we've talked about how critically important having the same citations are that match character for

1:10:23: character, business name, phone number, address, everywhere that citation appears. Uh, I have seen so many

1:10:29: businesses not get recommended by the Google AI overview because their citations weren't correct. And if you

1:10:36: would asked me how important are correct citations, if you'd asked me that like a few months ago, I would have said don't

1:10:42: worry about it. If the citations don't match, it doesn't matter. Who cares? Not a big deal. Well, in the last few

1:10:48: months, I've seen so much evidence that those AI systems care a lot about

1:10:54: consistent citations. So, my biggest concern with taking this tactic to try to rank on Google Maps is you're going

1:11:00: to shoot yourself in the foot when it comes to AI recommending the business, unless you go back and update all of

1:11:06: your citations so that the business name matches. Uh, and if you do that, great. Then knock yourself out. But if you

1:11:13: don't do that, it's the um I don't know, you're uh you're winning now. And it's

1:11:20: great, right? Winning now is really cool. But we've seen the AI overview start to encroach on the Google Maps

1:11:27: listings. I don't know what the future of that is. I don't know if the Google

1:11:32: Maps is going to go away in favor of an AI overview. I don't know if the Google Maps ranking algorithm is going to go

1:11:39: away and be replaced by the AI overview ranking algorithm. I don't know if nothing is going to happen whatsoever

1:11:45: and in 5 years it's August of 2030 and the Google Maps ranking algorithm is

1:11:51: pretty much the same as it is today. I don't know. Uh but all of the newer

1:11:57: stuff cares a lot about citation accuracy and consistency. The only thing

1:12:03: that doesn't is the Google Maps algorithm, which of course, you know, is a hundred times more volume than the

1:12:09: other ones combined. Um, I'm just concerned about how much longer that algorithm has to live. Um, it hasn't

1:12:17: changed significantly in 15 years. So maybe we'll be sitting here in 2040 and

1:12:23: it will be pretty much exactly the same as it is today. Um, I don't know. But I'm I'm ready for AI.

1:12:31: I'm trying to position myself and my clients so that if AI takes over more

1:12:37: and more and more of how Google's algorithm works, we're still being recommended by AI.

1:12:44: Anyway, uh hopefully that answered your question, guy. Uh right now, today it's

1:12:49: a great option. I'd just be worried about the long-term ramifications. All right, Davidid, what you got? Um just

1:12:57: short question because about the the service on the service box on the Google

1:13:02: on the GBP uh you can make a description and I I remember you said it's not

1:13:09: necessary but I was with uh I did the onboarding call with lead snap and the guy mentioned to I mean um recommend to

1:13:17: to do it. So, I was wondering what is your opinion on this and do you if you

1:13:22: do fill it, do you do you put a link to your to your page service page?

1:13:28: Yeah, we don't put links in there just cuz that's a lot of extra effort. Uh we'll usually fill them out because

1:13:33: again, right, this is something that just takes almost no time. AI can write those descriptions for you straight

1:13:39: away. Paste them in and you're done. Um it's not something that I would fret

1:13:45: about if I didn't have done. We have a lot of clients who are ranking really well and those services aren't filled

1:13:50: out. There's no description filled out. Um, but for new clients, I mean, we so similar to a meta description, right?

1:13:57: Like a meta description, I wouldn't spend resources to go and update 50 pages to put meta descriptions in, but

1:14:03: when we're creating new pages, of course, we put a meta description in. It takes no time at all to just throw a

1:14:08: meta description in since we're already adding the new page. So, that's sort of how I would look at it. Like I wouldn't fret about it, but I'd go ahead and put

1:14:14: it in if if you had the availability. Yeah. Okay. And no link. Uh I mean putting a

1:14:22: link into it sounded I we've never I mean we tried that and it had almost no impact on ranking. So

1:14:28: we you we don't bother. Okay. Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Sure. All right. If citations get fixed,

1:14:35: uh, guy, it can be, but I mean, again, there there's always the risk that when you have a spammy sounding GBP name that

1:14:41: you're going to get suspended. And even if you've been suspended and proven to Google that you have the DBA and that's

1:14:47: your actual business name, you might get suspended again. And I've seen issues where even with a DBA, with the business

1:14:54: name matching exactly, uh, the suspension is not lifted. Um, so spammy

1:15:00: GBP names are a risk. Uh yeah. Okay. And Hinrich, if we want to do the citations

1:15:07: with Lead Snap, but there are already some unknown entries from the past, isn't obligatory to clean up the old ones first? So there the if you have

1:15:14: existing citations on the services that lead snap has the API connections to the

1:15:20: 51 services, uh lead snap is capable of updating those citations with your new

1:15:27: information. If you're talking about citations beyond the ones highlighted by

1:15:32: lead snap, then uh yes, um if possible,

1:15:38: delete the those citations. Get them updated, get them corrected. Uh I never

1:15:43: thought I'd be saying this again, but we actually are spending time fixing old citations at this point. We don't

1:15:50: usually fix, I shouldn't say fix, we're spending time trying to get the old citations deleted, right? So, um, we

1:15:58: have a prompt that we use. Let me grab the prompt. We have a prompt that we use. Do I have the prompt here? I don't have the prompt here. Um, I've been

1:16:05: working on the prompt. So, we have a prompt that I've been working on that basically gets chat GPT's deep research

1:16:11: to crawl the internet looking for the citations and pull the contact information. So, when it full finds the

1:16:17: citations, uh, the first thing we do is check to see if that citation is indexed by Google. Most of these lowquality

1:16:22: citations are not indexed by Google. If it's not, then we stop caring about it. It doesn't matter. Uh move it move it

1:16:28: from the list. If it is indexed by Google, then we'll usually just reach out to whatever the directory website is

1:16:34: and ask them to delete the citation. Um yeah, cool. All right, Billy, what's

1:16:40: going on? Yeah. Yeah. Quick question. I I don't mean to go over this nesting stuff, but

1:16:45: I really don't understand it. I I put in chat GBT how to do it, and and I still

1:16:51: I'm not really sure how you do the nesting. And so can you explain it exactly how we should be doing this?

1:17:01: Yes. Let me see if I can find I'll search my history. Search chats. There

1:17:06: we go.

1:17:14: And my guess is if I have this question, other people do too.

1:17:30: All right. So when I asked chat GPT to do nested

1:17:40: schema markup, this is what it gave me. So I have uh context schema type

1:17:45: attorney and it gives the attorney name. So this is basically local business schema and then it's not fully closing

1:17:52: the local business schema. It goes right on to the rest of the like aggregate

1:17:58: rating opening hours. So this is the rest of the local business schema uh same as and it gives the social proof

1:18:05: and then it goes right into the type legal service uh and all of this description that is repeated and then

1:18:12: this award schema, right? And if I pull this whole list of

1:18:18: schema and I copy it over to the structure data testing tool

1:18:28: and I want the code skip it snippet. I get zero errors, zero warnings and it shows the legal service and the local

1:18:34: business schema for attorney. I is that helpful? I I mean I'm not a code expert

1:18:40: so I mean I can't write it myself. Um, I just get chat GPT to do it and then if

1:18:47: there's any errors or anything I make it redo it until there are no errors or warnings and then I post it on the

1:18:52: website. Got it. Okay. Thanks. Sure. Benjamin, what you got?

1:19:02: Um, kind of an off-topic question. Couple weeks ago you were talking about

1:19:07: your snapshot for GHL. I hate even asking the question. I went to download it. I'm a little bit late on it. And it

1:19:14: says the snapshot link you are using has already been used. So my question is, is

1:19:21: this a customized snapshot or is it just basically the uh template from GHL that maybe I downloaded in the past and

1:19:28: didn't even realize. So usually when I share the link or the uh snapshot, uh I

1:19:35: grab a one-time use only link. Um, so likely what happened with that,

1:19:41: Benjamin, is I messed up and uh shared

1:19:46: that one time only link twice. Okay. All right. So, let me give you a new link.

1:19:52: Do you want me to just send you a message in in school to send it over when you get a chance? I'll just shoot it now.

1:20:02: And is it Shannon? Uh, I'm not in school.

1:20:08: Yeah, Benjamin Shannon. Yeah. Yeah, you got it. All right. And the question that you

1:20:14: asked, are you just doing a site colon URL check? Yes, that's exactly that's all I'm doing. Site colon URL to see if

1:20:20: it's indexed. Okay, cool. That's all I got. Thanks, boss. Awesome. Jay, what you got, man?

1:20:28: You're muted. Yeah, I was trying to find it. I was working on the other screen. Oh, no problem.

1:20:34: And you know the getting old really sucks because by the time you got me I forgot what I was going to ask. So

1:20:46: all right. Well, uh, cool. Any other questions? Uh, Benjamin, you got

1:20:51: something else? Got to lower my hand, but yeah, I guess. um

1:20:57: in watching some old videos um with

1:21:02: interlinking um inside the website. I mean I go through

1:21:09: periods where it's like I got this and then I'll watch something from the past and something will be said and gets me

1:21:15: thinking like am I doing this wrong? Um and I think there was a discussion topic on it about um just say supporting

1:21:22: contact uh content. The way I have been structuring it is I have say you know my

1:21:31: uh my primary category I'm linking to the

1:21:37: to the service from that primary category page and then I want to link back right it's kind of like a circular

1:21:43: thing and then from that service page I may have supporting contact where I

1:21:49: would put in anchor link in a small 70 to 100word paragraph that would link to

1:21:54: the supporting content and then I would link back to that service page. Right? So, it's kind of as you as you move down

1:22:00: that silo, you're you're in you're linking from one page to the next and

1:22:05: from that page to the linking source page, right? So, we link uh down to the page

1:22:12: that we're trying to provide the additional relevance for. that page has a link back up

1:22:19: and then to any other supporting content pages that are supporting the same topic

1:22:25: on the same level. Okay. All right. Yeah. I thought I read like you just want to link to the page

1:22:32: you're trying to rank and I read it like you don't want to link back to wherever that came from came from. So,

1:22:39: all right, that's it. I'll lower my hand. Thank you. No problem. All right. Well, thank you

1:22:46: everyone for coming. I appreciate it. Appreciate the attendance. Hopefully this was valuable for you guys. Uh and

1:22:53: for Michelle, um yeah, sorry about that, Michelle. My my uh YouTube audience is

1:22:59: like 97% male. So, every once in a while, u a non-male comes in and I have to Anyway,

1:23:07: I'm just kind of rambling and mumbling now. Um yes. Uh but anyway, thank you everyone for

1:23:15: coming. I appreciate it. I'll get the recording posted today uh this afternoon or tomorrow. And uh we will see you guys

1:23:22: next Tuesday, August 19th. Uh and uh beyond that, if anything comes up in the

1:23:28: interim, feel free post it in the school group. Send me a message. If you aren't in AI SEO Mastery with Caleb Alku, which
