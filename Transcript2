## Introduction to SEO Pricing

0:00: so what I want to cover in this video is

0:01: how to price your SEO services for local

0:04: businesses so I'm going to break it into

0:06: two parts the first part is the first

0:09: month in the first month of a brand new

0:11: local business client there's going to

0:13: be a lot of things you do that you won't

0:15: do again so we're going to price that

0:17: differently than how we price out a

0:19: monthly ongoing engagement now I

0:21: personally don't like to charge a

0:23: different price for the first month and

0:24: for ongoing months so what we're going

0:26: to try to do is to choose a scope of

0:28: work that will allow us to have the same

## Pricing for the First Month

0:30: price but we get everything done that we

0:32: need to get done in that first month now

0:35: an important note about SEO pricing

0:38: there are really two different ways that

0:39: you can price SEO Services one is what I

0:42: call a scope of work-based pricing this

0:44: means you're going to tell the client

0:46: what you're going to do how many

0:47: articles you're going to write how many

0:49: pages you're going to optimize how many

0:50: links you're going to build uh and then

0:53: you're going to do that the other way is

0:56: what we refer to as SEO blackbox pricing

1:00: what this means is you will tell a

1:01: client what your monthly price is they

1:03: will pay you every month you won't tell

1:05: them what you're going to do and we're

1:07: all going to Hope rate position improves

1:10: I dramatically prefer scope of

1:11: work-based pricing it's transparent you

1:14: know what you're going to deliver the

1:15: client knows what they're going to get

1:17: and if for whatever reason rank position

1:20: doesn't improve you can at least be sure

1:22: the client knows you're delivering what

1:24: you said you would deliver of course no

1:26: client will stick with you forever if uh

1:28: they're paying you for SEO and the price

1:30: doesn't improve but let me tell you that

1:32: conversation is a lot harder if you're

1:34: using SEO blackbox pricing now my name

1:37: is Caleb Alon I started an SEO agency in

1:40: 2016 and it took me about 3 years to

1:42: build it to a seven figure agency since

1:45: then I've helped hundreds of

1:46: entrepreneurs start their own SEO

1:48: agencies and and grow them so let's talk

1:52: about local SEO and how to price it for

1:54: a brand new client I'm going to come on

1:56: over to the computer and show you my

1:57: scope based pricing worksheet so here's

## Excel Worksheet for SEO Pricing

2:00: my very fancy Excel sheet and uh I'm

2:03: going to provide a link to download this

2:05: if you want to use this uh I'm going to

2:07: put a link in the comments so you can

2:08: grab this for yourself and play around

2:10: with it so like I mentioned there are

2:12: two different buckets we're going to use

2:14: for the scope-based pricing the first

2:16: month and the ongoing SEO and the reason

2:20: for that is in this first month there's

2:22: a bunch of stuff that we only need to do

2:24: this one time so citations some local

2:27: businesses have citations some local

2:29: businesses don't have citations some

2:31: have citations that aren't very accurate

2:33: anymore now years ago citations were a

2:36: much more important ranking factor for

2:38: local search than they are today that

2:40: being said citations still help and in

2:43: fact the Google API leak shows citations

2:48: as a attribute for local SEO so we're

2:51: still going to do citations it's

2:53: $257 and we only need to do it once now

2:57: let me show you where to go if you need

2:59: a source for citations and you don't

3:01: want to hire someone to do it

3:07: yourself this is my recommended provider

3:10: we can see we have the citations right

3:11: there

3:12: $257 that's the price that I put in

3:15: assuming that you're going to use them

3:16: if you have your own in-house team

3:18: that's fine if you don't and you have

3:20: someone someone else that you prefer go

3:22: ahead and use them too the point here is

3:24: that we want to sign up your local

3:26: client website for as many citations as

3:29: we can find and it's a good source of

3:31: links but more importantly it

3:33: establishes your business as a real

3:36: business Google likes to see online

3:39: evidence that your client business

3:42: actually exists and a really quick and

3:44: easy way to do that is citations the

3:46: other thing we're going to do in this

3:47: first month is a press release now I say

3:50: this is a list of things that we do once

3:52: and then never again honestly a press

3:53: release is probably something that you

3:55: should be doing every 6 to9 months but

3:57: it's not regular so the first month

4:00: press release

4:01: $197 and again it that that it's right

4:05: there $197 so we're going to do that

4:07: press release okay now GBP optimization

4:11: we're going to use AI to do GBP

4:13: optimization I have another video on

4:15: this channel where I break down exactly

4:17: what we do for GBP optimization uh I'll

4:20: give you some prompts on that how to use

4:21: chat GPT to help you with this uh so I'm

4:24: not going to break that down here but

4:25: just know that it's going to cost it

4:27: cost me about $70 to do um and that's

4:31: the time for my employee to do it so

4:33: feel free to adjust this number to

4:35: whatever it is that it's costing you to

4:37: get this done homepage optimization in

4:40: that same video I break down how to use

4:42: chat GPT to optimize the homepage so

4:45: that it's consistent with the Google

4:47: business profile so again I'm not going

4:49: to break that down here just know that

4:51: it takes my team member about $50 worth

4:53: of time to make that happen now these

4:56: yellow cells and of course feel free to

4:58: change anything you like but these

## Google Business Profile Optimization Using AI

5:00: yellow cells are designed to be cells

5:02: that you change so in this first month

5:04: we can't just do citations press release

5:06: and optimization we also want to create

5:09: service Pages part of that is because we

5:11: want to get them results as fast as

5:13: possible of course the sooner we can

5:15: give clients results the more likely

5:17: they are to stay with us for the long

5:18: term but on top of that delivering new

5:21: pages of content new service pages is a

5:24: much more effective way to show a client

5:26: that you're doing something versus

5:27: giving them like an Excel sheet with a

5:30: bunch of citations a lot of clients

5:32: won't know what that means and they

5:33: won't appreciate what it took to get

5:35: that same thing for the press release or

5:37: these other services these need to be

5:38: done but they're not going to impress

5:40: your clients usually service Pages much

5:43: more likely to impress your clients so

5:46: we're going to create two of them and

5:47: the reason I chose two is so that our

5:49: quoted price reasonably lines up with

5:51: the ongoing estimate you could do one

5:53: you could do five you could do 10 it

5:55: depends on what price point you're

5:56: interested in quoting for this

5:57: particular client now we're going I'm

5:59: going to assume 1,500 words per page it

6:01: might be a little bit more it might be a

6:03: little bit less but that's usually a

6:04: pretty good estimate and dollar per word

6:06: and you can see that 7 cents per word

6:09: that comes straight out of the same

6:11: source that being said if you know how

6:14: to run chat GPT to get high quality

6:17: content it's almost certainly going to

6:19: be more costeffective for you to do this

6:21: yourself versus hiring uh a service to

6:23: do chat GPT for written content so this

6:26: is one I'd recommend uh you learn how to

6:29: use chat GPT to run this content I have

6:31: a video on this channel where I break

6:34: down exactly how to use it and give you

6:36: prompts to use chat GPT to write high

6:39: quality content so then it's going to

6:41: calculate the uh dollars for the service

6:43: pages and Link okay so we always know

6:46: that we need external links okay if we

6:49: don't get external links we're not going

6:51: to rank that sometimes Google has said

6:53: that internal links aren't important we

6:55: know that is not the case uh if you want

6:58: to rank you need links even in the

7:00: modern Google algorithm and we know the

7:03: leaked attributes again that link

7:06: quality uh number of links these are all

7:08: important attributes that's in that

7:10: search API documentation so we know that

7:13: we need links $31 per link that came

7:16: from again the same Source five links

7:19: are 157 so that works out to $31 a piece

7:23: and we're going to get two links and the

7:25: reason for two is cuz we created two

7:26: service pages so every page of content

7:28: that we publish we're going to get an

7:30: external link to point to that page

7:32: remember that external links is what

7:35: Google uses as a sign of quality uh this

7:37: was laid out in the original 1998

7:39: Stanford dissertation paper by Larry

7:41: pagee this is the gamechanging reason

7:44: why Google is the company this today

7:46: because he had the idea to use links

7:49: from other websites as a sign of quality

7:52: and they're still using that today okay

7:54: so then we're going to add up all of the

7:56: money that we spent and the citations

7:58: the press release optimis ations the

## Monthly Quotation Strategy

8:01: service Pages for the content the links

8:03: we're going to add it all up and here

8:05: I've chosen to go with a 50% margin so

8:07: we're going to quote the client $1,694 a

8:10: month now one quick note one thing that

8:13: I really like doing is providing clients

8:15: with a good better best so maybe this is

8:18: the good and you offer them or maybe

8:21: this is the better and you'll offer them

8:23: a good where there's no service Pages

8:25: created and you'll quote $1,200 so if

8:28: I'm a client and I'm like $1,200 for no

8:30: service Pages $1,700 for two service

8:33: Pages man that's a really good deal uh

8:35: those two service Pages for the extra

8:37: increment uh really really want to go

8:40: that route and then maybe you'll quote

8:41: them at best where you do 20 service

8:43: Pages for you know a much higher price

8:46: $6,000 or something like that now I say

8:49: service Pages here but this could be any

8:51: type of page it could be service Pages

8:53: or supporting content Pages uh but for

8:55: month one it's usually going to be

8:56: service Pages uh so that's how that

8:58: month one estimate comes together now

9:01: for ongoing again we don't need to do

9:03: citations a press release GBP

9:04: optimization hope we don't need to do

9:06: this every single month uh so for

9:08: ongoing we're just going to crank out

9:10: pages okay we know that topical

9:13: relevance topical Authority is a huge

9:15: part of Google's rank algorithm so we

9:18: want to create a lot of pages about the

9:22: so that we can establish topical

9:23: relevance for the keywords we're trying

9:25: to rank for okay so we're going to

9:28: choose the number of P just created so

9:30: that this quoted price is roughly

9:32: equivalent to this quoted price so if we

9:34: did the good option where we want $1,100

9:37: then maybe we're going to do four pages

9:39: here and then we're going to get pretty

9:40: close and if we have the best option

9:42: where say we're going to do 15 pages and

9:44: we're going to quote them $5,000 now

9:46: we're going to increase this until we

9:48: get to

9:48: $5,000 and we're going to say maybe

9:51: maybe 19 Pages a month so we're going to

9:53: play with these two numbers until we get

9:55: to reasonably equivalent values but for

9:58: now we'll just go with the 16 $100 price

## Final Thoughts and Resources

10:00: so we're going to do six pages a month

10:03: uh that's 1,500 words 7 cents a word and

10:06: again remember I said 7 cents per word

10:08: is expensive if you wanted to do do this

10:11: yourself you could probably do this for

10:13: as cheap as two cents a word and then if

10:15: you can do it for two cents a word you

10:18: can either increase your scope of work

10:20: or even more fun you can increase your

10:22: margin uh right so that this this price

10:25: keeps going up uh so there's any number

10:28: of ways that you can can uh utilize this

10:30: to get where you want to be but again

10:32: we'll just leave it here and we'll as

10:35: before we every time we publish an

10:37: article we're going to Source a link to

10:38: it that's how Google knows it's a

10:39: quality article so the number of links

10:41: matches the number of pages created we

10:43: have a total number of words this is an

10:45: excellent thing that you can show your

10:46: client look we're going to create 9,000

10:48: words a month for you it's going to cost

10:50: the $800 50% margin and your gross price

10:54: or your quoted price is reasonably the

10:56: same here so that's how we quote a local

10:59: SEO

11:01: engagement now like I said check in the

11:03: comments below I put a link there so you

11:06: can download this tool you can play

11:07: around with it it's pretty simple but

11:09: why build something if if I'll just give

11:11: it to you for free no problem and like I

11:13: said check out those other videos how to

11:15: optimize a GBP with AI that one's here

11:18: and how to use chat GPT to effectively

11:22: write content so you can beat my 7 Cent

11:24: per word cost I'm going to link that

11:26: video here
