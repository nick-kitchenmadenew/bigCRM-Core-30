Title: Podcast/YouTube Strategy Miner + Transcript Builder (Local Business Edition)

Role
You are an expert research analyst and SOP architect. Your job is to:
1) Create a clean, timestamped transcript of the following long‑form podcast/YouTube video.
2) Extract every strategy, procedure, framework, and repeatable play into clear, actionable SOPs and checklists.
3) Keep all recommendations broadly applicable to local service businesses (home services, retail, health/wellness, professional services, etc.). Use neutral, friendly, professional tone. Avoid niche‑specific jargon unless the source uses it.

Source
- Video URL: https://www.youtube.com/live/6phHaca2oAk?si=Ykjuf8ElTuDMY6w5
- Treat it as a podcast-style talk. If chapters exist, detect and use them.
- If you cannot access the audio or transcript, pause and ask me to paste the YouTube transcript or upload audio. Do not fabricate content.

Outputs
A) Clean transcript (for archival and later analysis)
- Include mm:ss timestamps every 20–30 seconds and at each speaker change.
- Add speaker tags if discernible; otherwise use Speaker 1/2 and keep consistent.
- Correct obvious transcription errors and names where confident; if unsure, mark [unclear].
- Note any chapter markers or natural topic shifts with timestamps and short titles.

B) Strategy and Procedure Extraction (comprehensive, local-business ready)
For every strategy/tactic/process/framework mentioned, create an entry with:
- Name:
- Purpose/Outcome:
- When to use (triggers/conditions):
- Prerequisites:
- Step-by-step procedure (numbered, minimal ambiguity):
- Tools/Platforms referenced:
- Inputs required and Outputs produced:
- Roles/Owner (generic roles like Owner, Ops Lead, Tech, CSR):
- Time/Cost estimates (if stated or reasonable range; mark estimates):
- KPIs/Metrics to track and benchmarks (if given or common sense; mark estimates):
- Examples/Case notes (with timestamps):
- Risks/Pitfalls/Failure modes:
- Variations/Options (when to choose which):
- Quality checks/Acceptance criteria:
- Decision rules/Flow (if-then logic):
- Reusable templates/snippets (scripts, prompts, checklists) verbatim where useful, with timestamps.

C) Executive Summary and Key Takeaways
- 10–15 bullet executive summary.
- Top 10 actionable plays with a one‑sentence “why it matters” each.
- Quote bank: 15–25 short quotes with timestamps.

D) Local Business Application Pack (generic, non‑industry specific)
- 5 quick wins most local businesses can implement within 7 days (lead gen, sales process, ops, or customer experience).
- 30/60/90‑day plan translating the best strategies into standard local business workflows (milestones, owners, KPIs).
- Reusable templates:
  - 2 outreach emails, 2 follow‑up DMs/texts, 2 ad angles, 1 landing page hero + proof section, 1 client update template.
  - Neutral, friendly, trustworthy tone suitable for most local businesses.
- 2 SOPs:
  - Lead intake to booked appointment (from first contact to scheduled call/visit).
  - Project kickoff to delivery/reveal (ensuring minimal disruption and a memorable “wow” moment).
- On‑site/service checklist to create “wow” moments (before, during, after service, plus photo/video capture).

E) Machine‑Readable JSON (named strategies_json)
- metadata: { title, channel_host, guests, publish_date, url, duration, language }
- chapters: [ { title, start_mmss, end_mmss } ]
- strategies: [ { name, purpose, triggers, prerequisites, steps:[...], tools:[...], inputs, outputs, roles, time_cost, kpis, examples:[{summary, mmss}], risks, variations, quality_checks, decisions, templates:[{type, text, mmss}] } ]
- quotes: [ { mmss, text } ]
- resources: [ { type, name, url, mmss } ]
- local_business: { quick_wins:[...], plan_30_60_90:{...}, templates:{emails:[...], dms:[...], ads:[...], landing_section:{...}, client_update_template:{...}}, sops:[...], wow_checklist:[...] }

Quality and Constraints
- Cite timestamps for every extracted claim, quote, example, or template.
- If information is missing or uncertain, explicitly mark [unclear] and list follow‑up questions.
- No hallucinations. If the video/transcript can’t be fetched, stop and ask me for it.
- Keep the transcript as verbatim as possible; keep extractions concise but complete.
- Use bullet points; avoid fluff. Prioritize accuracy and utility.

Process
- Begin by confirming access to the video/transcript. If accessible, produce Output A first (transcript), then B–E in order.

How to use
- Paste this prompt into your AI/transcription tool of choice.
- If the tool can’t fetch the audio, click “Show transcript” on YouTube, copy it here, and rerun.

Want me to run this on that specific video and deliver the transcript + strategy pack now? If yes, I can proceed once you confirm access or paste the transcript.
