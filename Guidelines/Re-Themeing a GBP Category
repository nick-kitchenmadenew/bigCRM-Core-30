Re-Themeing a GBP Category

For most local businesses, finding the right Google Business Profile (GBP) category is straightforward. If you're a plumber targeting "plumber Houston," there's a GBP category for that. If you're a roofer targeting "roofer Houston," there's a category for that too.

But what happens when your target keyword doesn't have an exact GBP category match?

This lesson covers a powerful technique called "re-theming" that allows you to rank for keywords that don't perfectly align with available GBP categories.



Understanding the Challenge

Let's use a real example: car accident lawyer Houston

This is a high-value keyword, but here's the problem ‚Äì there's no GBP category specifically for "car accident lawyer." The closest options are:





Civil Law Attorney (secondary category)



Personal Injury Attorney (usually primary category)

So how do you signal to Google that you want to rank for "car accident lawyer" when you're forced to choose a different category? That's where re-theming comes in.



The Re-Theming Strategy

Re-theming creates a bridge between your chosen GBP category and your target keyword. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Create a Category-Matched URL

Build a URL that exactly matches your secondary GBP category:

yourdomain.com/civil-law-attorney


This shows Google that your website structure aligns with your GBP categories ‚Äì a crucial consistency signal.



üí° Best Practice: Always create URLs that match your secondary GBP categories, even when they're not your primary target keywords. This strengthens the connection between your website and your GBP listing.



2. Optimize the Title Tag for Your Target

Use your actual target keyword in the title tag:

Car Accident Lawyer Houston | Get Legal Help Today  



3. Use the GBP Category in Your H1

This is one of the rare times where your H1 should differ from your title tag. Use the exact GBP category match:

<h1>Civil Law Attorney Houston</h1>

This critical step tells Google: "Yes, we understand we chose this GBP category, and our content reflects that choice."



4. Focus Content on Your Target Keyword

After establishing the category connection with your URL and H1, the rest of your content should focus on your actual target:





H2 headings about car accidents



H3 headings with keyword variations and modifiers



Body content optimized for "car accident lawyer Houston" and related terms

You won't need to mention "civil law attorney" again after the H1 ‚Äì you've already made the connection clear to Google.



Common Re-Theming Scenarios

Here are other situations where re-theming might be necessary:

Estate Planning Services: When targeting "estate planning lawyer" but the closest GBP category is "Elder Law Attorney," you'd create the URL /elder-law-attorney while focusing your content on estate planning services.

DUI Defense: For "DUI attorney" targets with only "Criminal Lawyer" as a category option, use /criminal-lawyer as your URL but optimize all content for DUI defense.

Divorce Services: When pursuing "divorce lawyer" rankings with "Family Law Attorney" as your category, structure it as /family-law-attorney with divorce-focused content throughout.



‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note: Only use re-theming when there's a genuine semantic relationship between your target keyword and the GBP category. The category should logically encompass your target service.



Implementation Tips

When re-theming a GBP category, remember to identify the closest relevant GBP category first. This should be a category that genuinely relates to your service ‚Äì don't force connections that don't make sense. Create an exact-match URL for that category, use your target keyword in the title tag, and place the GBP category as your H1. Then focus all other content elements on your target keyword while ensuring the relationship between category and target remains logical.



üîó Next Steps: After implementing re-theming, review the "Local Business Schema" lesson to add structured data that reinforces your category choices while highlighting your specific services.
