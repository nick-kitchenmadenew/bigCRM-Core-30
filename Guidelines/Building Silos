Core 30 Content Silo Structure

The Core 30 creates topical relevance by mirroring your Google Business Profile (GBP) structure on your website. Here's the framework:
The 3-Level Hierarchy
Level 1: Homepage

Targets: [Primary Category] + [City]
Contains H2 sections for each category (60-80 words each)
Links down to category pages
May highlight 1-2 critical services (must be relevant to primary category)

Level 2: Category Pages

One page per GBP category (1,500+ words each)
These become the "pillar" pages of each silo
Contains H2 sections for services underneath that category
Each service gets 70-100 words + link to its service page

Level 3: Service Pages

One page per service listed in GBP (1,500+ words each)
These are nested under their parent category
Link back up to their category page

Critical Silo Rules
❌ NEVER link across silos - Even if services seem related (like "plastic surgeon" and "cosmetic surgeon"), keep them separate. This siloed structure builds powerful topical relevance.
✅ Proper internal linking:

Use plain text links (not buttons)
Surround links with 70-100 words of content about the page you're linking to
Place links in context under relevant H2 headers

Geographic Content
Geographic pages (for different neighborhoods/cities) live in their own separate silo:

Usually built around the primary category
Each location gets its own silo structure
Won't necessarily need all 30 pages per location - check rank maps to see what's needed

Example Structure
Homepage (Kitchen Remodeling City)
├─ Cabinet Maker (Category Silo)
│  ├─ Cabinet Refacing
│  ├─ Cabinet Refinishing
│  └─ Cabinet Painting
├─ Painter (Category Silo)
│  └─ [Painting Services]
└─ Kitchen Remodeler (Category Silo)
   ├─ Countertop Installation
   └─ Countertop Replacement
The beauty of this structure is that it builds topical authority systematically - Google learns to trust your domain for your primary category and related services.
