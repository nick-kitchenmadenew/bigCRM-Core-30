When to Add Supporting Content
Supporting content is created after the Core 30 is built to boost topical relevance when a service page isn't ranking well. You determine the need by checking your rank maps - if a service is still red/yellow, you need more topical authority.
Supporting Content Linking Structure
✅ YES - You CAN cross-link supporting pages laterally
Here's the proper structure:
Service Page (Money Page)
├─ Supporting Article 1 ←→ Supporting Article 2
├─ Supporting Article 2 ←→ Supporting Article 3  
└─ Supporting Article 3 ←→ Supporting Article 1
The linking rules:

Service page links DOWN to supporting content (with 70-100 words of context under an H2)
Supporting content links BACK UP to the service page it supports
Supporting pages at the same level CAN link to each other horizontally/laterally
All links should be plain text, editorial links surrounded by relevant content

Example Implementation
Let's say you have a "Leaky Faucet Repair" service page that's not ranking:
On the Service Page:

Add an H2: "Common Causes of Leaky Faucets"
Write 70-100 words
Link to Supporting Article 1: "Why Your Faucet Won't Stop Dripping"

Supporting Article 1:

Links back up to "Leaky Faucet Repair" service page
Can link laterally to Supporting Article 2 about "How to Identify Faucet Types"

Supporting Article 2:

Links back up to "Leaky Faucet Repair" service page
Can link back to Supporting Article 1

How Much Supporting Content?

Typical volume: 4-8 articles per month per client
Start with Core 30 first, then add supporting content based on rank map needs
Supporting content can be blog posts or pages (doesn't matter)
Each supporting article typically gets a PBN link ($31) for validation signals

Key Point
Supporting content often ranks for longtail keywords on its own, which is fine. But by linking it properly to your money page, you're building topical authority signals that help the main service page rank better.

Here's an example of a complete structure with supporting content added:

Homepage (Kitchen Remodeling City)
│
├─ Cabinet Maker (Category Silo)
│  │
│  ├─ Cabinet Refacing
│  │  │
│  │  └─ SUPPORTING CONTENT (if not ranking):

   │     └─ "Countertop Edge Profiles: Choosing the Right Style"
   │        ↑ All link back to Countertop Installation page
   │        ↔ All can cross-link to each other

            ↑ All link back to Countertop Replacement page
            ↔ All can cross-link to each other
Linking Legend:
↑ = Links UP to parent service page (required)
↔ = Can link LATERALLY to sibling supporting articles (optional but recommended)
│ = Hierarchical relationship
└─ = Child page under parent
Implementation Rules:
On Service Pages (Money Pages):
Add H2 sections like:
H2: "Understanding Cabinet Refacing Costs"
[70-100 words about costs]
Link to: "Cabinet Refacing Cost Guide [City]"

H2: "Cabinet Refacing vs Complete Replacement"  
[70-100 words comparing options]
Link to: "Cabinet Refacing vs Replacement: Which is Right?"
On Supporting Articles:

Each article: 1,000-1,500 words
Include 2-3 external authority links (Forbes, Harvard, etc.)
ONE contextual link back to parent service page
1-2 lateral links to related supporting articles
Gets 1 PBN link ($31)

Production Schedule:
Month 1: Build Core 30 (8 pages shown above)
Month 2+: Check rank maps, add 4-8 supporting articles/month to weak pages
Example: If "Cabinet Refacing" is only 30% green on rank map:

Add 2 supporting articles per week for 4 weeks = 8 articles
Check rank map again after 30 days
Continue until page hits 60-70% green

Critical DON'Ts:
❌ Never link Cabinet Maker supporting content to Painter supporting content
❌ Never link Countertop supporting content to Cabinet supporting content
❌ Keep silos completely separate - no cross-category linking
This structure maintains topical silos while building massive authority for individual service pages that need ranking help.
