- **description**: Weekly AI SEO Community Call Summary

ðŸ“Œ Executive Summary

This weekly call focused on local SEO fundamentals, with extensive discussion about Google Business Profile optimization, internal/external linking strategies, and content creation workflows. The session provided practical guidance on category selection, schema implementation, and AI-powered content production processes.

ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways





Primary category selection is critical - choose based on what customers actually search for, not just what describes your business



Internal linking should flow both up and down between category and service pages



External authority links (to sites like Harvard, Forbes) should be included in most content at 1 per 500-700 words



Local SEO success is measured by expanding your "green zone" on rank maps farther from your business address



AI content workflows can produce ready-to-post articles in about 20 minutes with proper systems

ðŸ“Š Main Discussion Points

Google Business Profile Categories





HVAC contractors should often use "Air Conditioning Repair" as primary category instead of "HVAC Contractor"



Use GMB Everywhere tool to research category popularity and competition



Primary category determines what you rank for first - choose based on actual search behavior



Secondary categories matter but can be easily lost if team members make unauthorized changes

Linking Strategies





Internal links: Homepage â†’ Categories â†’ Services (bidirectional linking recommended)



External authority links: Include 2-3 links to high-authority sites (Harvard, Forbes, etc.) in most content



These external links help reduce AI detection scores and improve indexing



Chamber of Commerce and sponsorship links build trust signals with Google

Content Creation Workflow





AI content editor produces articles in ~20 minutes (3 per hour)



Pricing: $30 for first 10 articles, then $15 each (equals $45/hour)



Overseas support handles images, schema, and compression for $5/article



Custom Claude projects created for each client to maintain consistency and avoid prohibited content

Local SEO Fundamentals





Three ranking factors: Proximity, Relevance (topical + geographical), and Trust



Goal is expanding rank map coverage farther from business address



Topical relevance achieved at 30-40% top-3 ranking, then shift to geographical content



Service area businesses are much harder to rank than location-based businesses

ðŸ’¡ Notable Q&A

Q: Should I put FAQ sections on all Core 30 pages? A: About one-third of pages get FAQs - primarily GBP landing page, main category pages, and key service pages. This maintains content variety across the site.

Q: How do I handle competitor analysis when results seem inconsistent? A: Local competitor analysis often misleads because ranking factors like goal completion (customer satisfaction) and historical performance aren't visible. Focus on your own metrics instead.

Q: Can I use my home address for a Google Business Profile? A: Yes, home-based businesses can still be verified, though some users report increased difficulty. Avoid service area business designation as these are much harder to rank.

Q: How many Facebook ad creatives should I test? A: Start simple - the original ad in the training outperformed all variations. Focus on cost per lead ($5 good for B2B) rather than click-through rates.

ðŸ”® Emerging Trends & Challenges





Increased difficulty in GBP verification for home-based businesses



Growing importance of AI content workflows in scaling operations



Need for better tools to manage multi-location businesses and prevent unauthorized GBP changes



Rising complexity in balancing AI efficiency with content quality and originality

0:02: Yeah, there's there's a bunch of stuff in there that you could opt into or opt out of.

0:08: All right. Well, good afternoon everybody. Welcome. Welcome. Thank you, George, for that piece of advice. I was

0:14: just apologizing to everyone for being a little bit tardy because of how many

0:19: notetakers I had to kick out of the meeting, but we're here now. It is, of

0:24: course, Tuesday, September 9th at 100 p.m. Central. It's

0:30: 10:03. Like I said, I'm a little late. Um, so yeah, welcome, welcome everyone. Uh, we have a a fun-filled SEO Q&A

0:39: session here. So, we'll go by the same rules we have the last few weeks. I think that's gone pretty well. If you

0:45: have a question that you want that you don't need to speak for, that you don't

0:51: wanna want or need uh to talk during the meeting for, go ahead, put it in the chat. I'll hit a bunch of those chat

0:58: questions in between each hand raised question. And uh the hand raised questions, we'll do one at a time. I'll

1:05: answer your question, but you only get the one. Once the one is answered, put

1:10: your hand down. You can put it back up again. Otherwise, some poor people end up waiting like two hours to get their

1:16: question answered. So, if you have multiple ones, no problem. We'll sit here and we'll answer as many as I can

1:22: until it's time for me to go get my kids from school. Um, so yeah, if you have multiple ones, we'll just do one without

1:28: any follow-up questions. And before we get started, I have to say that right now I am in an absolutely terrible mood

1:36: because I was trying to get tickets to Ariana Grande. Uh, so I registered for the pre-sale and they completely sold

1:43: out before I got even into the queue. Very sad. Um,

1:49: very sad. But anyway, that's that's all I'll say about that. Uh, Lolita, how are

1:55: you doing? What's going on? What you got for me? Um so I think I finished the core 30 but

2:03: I am a little confused um on the internal linking so I just need to link

2:11: the categories to the services and put this the categories on the front page and I don't have to do any external

2:19: links in the category pages and the service pages right so so uh the internal links you

2:26: got correct homepage links to the category page pages, category pages, links to their service pages, golden. If

2:31: you have any additional topical content, uh then you would link the page that the

2:38: topical content is supporting to that page. Right? So you have a service page

2:44: for leaky faucets. Uh for whatever reason, you're not ranking for leaky faucets. So, you need more topical

2:50: content. Then all of the topical content will be linked to from the leaky faucet

2:56: and will link back up to the leaky faucet. The external links, we call them

3:03: uh external authority links. These are going to be links in your content that go to like harvard.edu or Forbes.com.

3:10: Wikipedia is a popular one, but please don't use Wikipedia for every single one. You got to mix it up. uh we put uh

3:17: two to three of those. It's basically oneish per 500 to 700 words in pretty

3:24: much all the content we produce. So category pages, service pages, uh blog

3:29: articles. The only exception would be things like the privacy policy or like the about us, contact us, those we

3:35: wouldn't put. But in almost every other scenario, including the homepage, we're going to put those authority links. Um,

3:42: all of the testing that we've done, Google loves those authority links and

3:47: putting links to authority relevant articles will help you rank faster. So,

3:53: we put them in all over the place. It's also pretty fascinating because when you put those uh authority links in your

4:02: percent AI written plummets on the zero GPT other checkers because AI when it

4:08: writes content it doesn't usually put authority links in unless you very specifically ask it to. So that really

4:14: helps the drop the percent uh AI also good. It also helps you get indexed. So

4:20: we just put it in. Was that did that was that the question you had? Yes. Yes, it was expanded but yes. So

4:28: the links for the authority links. So let's say for example the chamber of

4:33: commerce. I am getting a chamber of commerce link. Do I put that link in

4:38: each of the category pages and each of the services pages? So it would be a different link, right?

4:45: It would be a different authority link. So, in one you might link to a Harvard article about

4:51: leaky faucets, and another one you might link to a Forbes article about clogged

4:56: toilets. And I know it sounds silly, but you can find these posts on these big authority sites. So, yeah, every link is

5:03: going to be ideally to a different domain, but just make sure it's a relevant article that you're linking to,

5:10: relevant to the content you wrote. So for the for example for the chamber

5:16: of commerce link where do I put a link on the homepage? Sorry. Sorry. Okay. So we're getting a

5:21: little bit confused here. Uh that's why I wanted to make sure I understood your question. Okay. So there are two types

5:27: of external links. So one I call them the like uh external authority links.

5:32: That's a link from your content out to third party sites. Okay? That you should

5:38: be doing on most all of your content. The other one is a link from an external site back to your site. So that's going

5:44: to be like the Chamber of Commerce, right? So you'll join the Chamber of Commerce, you'll put in whatever your

5:50: website URL is and then that will appear as a link back to your website URL. So

5:55: for those types of things though, um, and you also have like if you sponsored a youth sports league or you sponsored

6:02: the Bayou Bash. uh for my own website, uh my own agency website, I'm not really

6:08: trying to rank it, but there's a TEDex here on the Mississippi GF Coast. First time they've ever had one, so I

6:14: sponsored that event. Uh so I will get a link from like aedu college uh thanking

6:20: me for sponsoring the TEDex uh event. It was a little bit more uh but the cheapest sponsorship for that event was

6:27: $250. And I can guarantee that if you had a local business like a plumber on

6:32: the Mississippi Gulf Coast and you gave them $250 to sponsor this event, that

6:38: would probably be enough to get you ranked in the top three pretty consistently. Uhedu from a local

6:44: college, man. So, uh, those that type of link should in general go to your GVP

6:50: landing page. So, yeah. And that's what the local offsites prompt is for. The

6:56: other ones I'm talking about, you'll just have your article, your content, and then inside that content, you'll

7:01: just have a link to Forbes. Those are super easy to do. Your VA can do them. Uh AI can do them for you if you ask it

7:08: to. Uh those are not links back to your site. You'll you need the links back to your site also to build that trust with

7:14: Google. I don't know. Hopefully, I'm making sense there. Let me know if I'm not and I can try to explain it again

7:21: from the beginning. Uh yes. Yes. What I'm understanding is the links that go from the website outside

7:28: those are the authority links from the content which includes the pages that

7:35: are categories or services and the pages where it's like content and blogs um and

7:43: I have links in those pages all these different type of pages outside to other

7:48: authority content right yeah yep and then the other ones the chamber of

7:55: commerce and the other ones the external links which is um from other people to

8:00: my website. Yes. Okay. So to optimize the curve 30 just

8:07: the category pages and the service pages they have the FAQ sections as well.

8:15: Right. Sorry say it one more time. So for inside of the core 30 what I'm

8:23: referring the core 30 just the category and the service pages no content just service and cate category pages these

8:31: ones do contain the FAQ sections in them

8:36: they can yeah if you have FAQ sections yeah they well would that be ideal to have

8:43: the FAQ sees in in them so we do FAQ sections sometimes not every page has them Um, it's typically

8:50: if we we put an FAQ in if we need additional topical relevance. Uh, a GBP landing page will usually have an FAQ

8:57: section and other pages we'll put in as we need them. But, you know, I'd say probably a third of the content we

9:04: publish has an FAQ p FAQ section, but not all.

9:09: Okay. All right. Cool. So, again, let me know, put your hand up again if uh there are additional

9:15: questions or if we need additional clarity. Uh hopefully that made sense. All right, let us go over to Matt

9:22: who dropped 11 questions. All right, so we're not going to hit all of them straight away, Matt, but we'll get

9:28: started here. And thank you for the kind words. Obviously, that's fabulous. Uh

9:33: maybe I will hit all of them since he started with flattery. That that really works for me. All right, so the first

9:39: one, it seems categories and services are extremely important for laying the foundation. Uh 100%. Yep. If you have

9:44: the wrong categories, especially the primary category, that's obviously the most important. If your primary category

9:49: is wrong, then even if you do the work to rank, you won't get calls. Uh so the

9:55: primary category is critical. Uh one of my favorite examples when we talk about the importance of primary categories is

10:01: HVAC contractors because you might think, hey, they're an HVAC contractor,

10:07: therefore the primary category should be HVAC contractor. And you would be wrong. Uh if you rank in the top three for HVAC

10:14: contractor, you will not get very many phone calls. Uh that's because not many local people search for HVAC contractor.

10:22: Uh they typically are searching for air conditioning repair. So that should be your primary category. Uh you'll rank

10:29: for your primary category first. So that's just I like that example for HVAC contractor. It makes sense. And when you

10:35: look at uh people who are ranking for air conditioning repair, most of them have air conditioning repair as a

10:41: primary service. But you will see a bunch of people who have chosen HVAC contractor as the primary service. They

10:46: just made it harder on themselves. So the way that we do this, your next followup, what kind of involvement does

10:52: the client have? How do you handle this? So the way we handle this for every new client, the very first thing we do is a

10:58: GBP audit where we basically we have a a

11:03: Google doc. it's in the training and we walk through that Google doc with the client's website and their GVP open and

11:10: we fill it in and then we recommend the changes that we would make uh to their GBP based on what we're seeing. Uh that

11:17: gets sent over to the client and we say hey here's the changes we want to make and we want to make them right. Uh so

11:23: many times we've said oh client sure go ahead and make the changes yourself and that's a disaster. I don't know why it's

11:29: so hard for them to make the changes themselves, but like, you know, oh, go ahead, make the changes yourself. And

11:35: then they end up adding every service under every category or something like that. And it's just like, no, you did it

11:41: wrong. Now it's worse than it was. Why did you add all these services everywhere? That's not what we said to do. Anyway, um, so we send them, here's

11:49: what we think should be changed. Let me know if you have any questions, feedback, or approval to change. They'll

11:55: say approved, and we go on and make the changes. So part of that is going to be like the HVAC example uh that you know

12:02: we've worked in the space before. We know what people are typically searching for. So we know what the primary category what's a good primary category.

12:10: The other way that is a lot obviously less experience-based is if you rely on GMBB everywhere uh

12:17: where you pull up a relevant category. It's going to tell you how many businesses are using what category and

12:23: then you just make a judgment call. So if you use GMBB everywhere to look up

12:28: HVAC contractor, you'll see that the most common primary category is HVAC contractor and the second most common

12:35: but it's really really close is air conditioning repair services. So when you see that then you you you know you'd

12:41: look at that and think hm boy that's interesting. Air conditioning repair services is a super popular secondary

12:47: category or a super popular primary category. Which one of those make the most sense for me as a primary category?

12:54: Do not gloss over that step. It's super easy to be like, I'm going to pick the one that has the highest volume and then

13:00: move on. But don't do that. Look at the ones that GMBB is telling you. Look at the numbers and think about, hey, what

13:06: makes sense? You can even screen snip the GMBB everywhere shot that shows all of the numbers of the different

13:12: categories and give it to chat GPT and say, hey, I'm trying to rank on Google.

13:17: Uh, which of these make the most sense as a primary category in your mind? And if you asked it that for HVAC contractor

13:24: versus air conditioning repair, it would tell you air conditioning repair makes the most sense. Um, so anyway, hopefully

13:31: that answered that question. Do you do the content audit after? Yes. Um, so we do the GBP audit and then the next thing

13:38: we do is the uh homepage uh audit uh the homepage audit. Reason we do it in that

13:45: order is we can't do the homepage audit until we've done the GBP audit because an important part of the homepage audit

13:52: is what are their primary categories, secondary categories and services. So we do the GBP audit first. We get approval

13:58: on the GBP audit. Then while one team member is making the GBP changes, another team member is kicking off the

14:04: GBP audit or the GBP homepage, GBP landing page audit. Um, and once we do

14:10: the homepage audit, GBP landing page audit, then we do the content gap analysis. Um, and same type of process.

14:18: The person who finishes the homepage audit moves right into the content gap analysis while we shoot the homepage

14:24: audit off to the client to get their feedback. Uh, so it's sort of a sort of series type of doot d. All right. For

14:32: Manhattan businesses, we always use NYC. Depends on the business, honestly. Um, but if they're located in Manhattan, uh,

14:39: of the five burrows, Manhattan is the one in my experience that people are the most likely to say their address is New

14:45: York, New York. Um, very I don't think I've ever seen somebody say that they

14:50: live in Manhattan, New York. And, you know, if they live in Brooklyn, it's like twothirds of them will say they

14:56: live in Brooklyn, New York, and one-third will say New York, New York. Uh, but the outer burrow is much more

15:01: common that you see the burrow New York, whereas in Manhattan it's almost always New York, New York. So, typically we use

15:08: NYC unless the client has some other very compelling reason for us not to. Um, all right. Can you please give some

15:15: tips on finding a good editor for humanizing AI generated content? How much content do you give per editor? How do you work out pricing? Great question.

15:22: And I think Bill Billy asked this question a few weeks ago. So um

15:28: initially I had I had uh 12 full-time copy editors uh and I had one person who

15:36: was running that copy editing team. Uh chat GBPt3 and a half came out suddenly

15:41: I didn't need all these copy editors. Um so that one person instead of running

15:46: the copywriting team she basically started running AI. So her job was almost the same, but instead of managing

15:53: copywriter, she's now managing AI. Um, so eventually we got to a point where

16:00: she wasn't able to keep up, just her. So we brought on board a new uh copywriter.

16:05: We now have two AI copywriters. Um, and we have some training documentation. Uh,

16:13: we're still sort of feeling out to make sure that training documentation works, to make sure it makes sense. Once I'm in

16:18: a place with it where it's really h where I'm really happy with it and it's working well. My intent was to add it to

16:23: the training. Um so this is the second person we brought on board since we

16:28: started this uh AI copy writing process.

16:33: Uh so once we're in a place with the second one, it'll be good enough that I'll I'll be happy with it to to put

16:39: some of that documentation up how we did it, etc. Um uh now I found the person. I basically posted on my Facebook wall and

16:45: said, "Hey, I'm looking to hire an AI copywriter, fully remote position." Um,

16:51: I that was in retrospect perhaps a mistake because I got dozens and dozens of people messaging me. Um, so that's

17:00: one option. You could go to Upwork. If you do go to Upwork, I would strongly encourage you to not use overseas talent

17:07: for this. uh you're really looking for somebody with editing experience, not with copywriting experience. Uh the pay

17:14: structure that we did, so how much content per editor? It's whatever they

17:19: could handle. They'd say, I'd ask, "Hey, how many articles could you do each each week?" They'd give me a number, and

17:25: that's what we'd give them. And if we had more, we'd have to find another person. Um, so I know because we've been

17:33: doing this for years now that my uh employee, my SEO manager, uh, she can

17:41: produce a content from zero to ready to post in about 20 minutes. Um, so that's

17:51: about three per hour. So the pricing that we do is they give us a ready to

17:57: post article. So that means the content is written uh by AI. It's edited. They

18:03: have added the external links like the links out to Forbes, to Wikipedia, whatever. And they've run it through

18:09: zero GPT themselves. So they're going to deliver my SEO manager, the Google doc

18:16: with a document, uh and the zero GPT score. Um for that, a ready to post

18:22: piece of content. For the first 10, I pay $30 a piece. uh just cuz there's a

18:28: ramp up time, there's a learning time. Um and then after the first 10, it drops to $15 a piece. Uh that works out to $45

18:36: an hour for someone who is pretty good at it by that point. And usually they are after they do the first 10. $45 an

18:43: hour for a fully remote job that they can work whenever the hell they want. I don't care if it's 2:00 in the morning

18:49: or 2:00 in the afternoon. All I care about is give me a ready to post article and then I will uh you know process your

18:58: 1099 payment. Um so that a lot of people are interested in that. I think it's a

19:03: good salary for that type of work. Um now we did run into a bit of a snafu

19:08: with images. So we've added yet another step where I do have an overseas person.

19:14: Uh so uh my local not local to me but my native English-speaking content writer I

19:23: writer in quotes uh AI runner uh they will produce the content uh get it ready

19:29: to post uh my SEO manager double checkcks the content make sure it's good

19:34: and then it gets sent to someone uh who's overseas and he will generate uh

19:40: three to four AI images he'll generate alt text for those images. Uh he'll

19:45: compress the images, make sure the size of the image is correct, and he'll generate schema for those articles. Then

19:51: he'll shoot it back to my SEO editor with the images, the schema, and everything. And then my editor, uh my

19:59: manager, not editor, she used to be editor. I get confused. Anyway, my manager, she shoots it over to the

20:04: developer and he finally posts it with the images, with the schema. Everything is good to go. uh that overseas

20:11: developer to generate the images, to generate the schema, uh is we pay him $5

20:16: an article. Uh hopefully that answered your question. That was probably more

20:21: detailed than you were looking for. Uh let's see. Are you willing to share a writing sample you include with your AI

20:27: content prompt? Oh, because we look for writing samples. I mean, I could. It's not that big of a deal, honestly. Um

20:34: I've shown a couple of client websites on these pro calls before, so you could grab that. really the writing sample it

20:41: it's not super critical. Uh probably the best thing that you could use as a

20:46: writing sample is uh content that is ranking in your local uh industry for

20:53: your local city. Right? So if you're a plumber in New Orleans, grab the homepage for the three plumbers in New

20:59: Orleans and give that to AI. It will be most likely more relevant than some generic sample. And uh what we do uh and

21:08: the AI cop copywriters we work with do this also. They set up a custom project in claude which is exactly the same as a

21:15: custom GPT. Uh they set one of those up for every single client. Um we used to

21:20: not but we shifted toward setting them up for every client. And the reason for that different clients have different

21:26: things that they want right. So we just got uh we had an HVAC contractor um in

21:32: South Florida. We just landed another one and we sent him the first batch of content. And he said, "Man, this is

21:37: talking about truck mounted air duct cleaning. We don't have any truck mounted air ducts. Uh, we do it this

21:44: other way." Hey, no problem. We'll get that edited and then we can go into the project in Claude and say, "Do not

21:51: mention air truck mounted air duct cleaning." And that will never happen again. Uh, it it's also pretty common

21:57: for medical professionals. There are certain things they're not allowed to say. So, the first couple of pieces

22:02: they'll say, "Hey, I can't say this. I can't say this. I can't say this. No problem." We'll put those can't say in

22:08: Claude, and then uh Claude, in my experience at least, is very good usually about following specific

22:14: instructions. For those of you who have watched the 10K challenge uh recordings, you'll know that it's not always great

22:21: at it. Uh sometimes it hallucinates even when I am very specific. But at least uh

22:26: we haven't had a lot of issues with Claude putting things like that in content when we specifically said right

22:32: don't mention um don't mention truck mounted air duct cleaning blah blah blah

22:38: okay is there such thing as too much supporting content absolutely there is um now it won't hurt you in my

22:45: experience but eventually you get to a point where you just don't need anymore you have the topical relevance Google

22:51: believes that your business does what your business say it says it does. So

22:57: there's no real reason. You're not going to rank higher by doing more and more supporting content. So it won't hurt

23:03: you, but it will also stop helping you. So at that point is when we would stop producing supporting content because you

23:10: know why am I going to spend resources money to produce supporting content that isn't going to do anything?

23:16: Um okay. When do you revamp a website versus start with a new URL? I don't do either of those things. Um about the

23:23: worst I would do uh is if we had a client who had hundreds and hundreds of

23:29: indexed URLs and the ranking was terrible. Um then we would pro not

23:34: probably then we would start with a technical audit, see why it's so bad and

23:39: eventually work toward um basically fixing the the website. Right? If

23:45: there's that much content that's indexed and the ranking is that bad, there's something seriously wrong with the

23:51: website. But we will almost never like relaunch a website from scratch because then you you lose everything that you've

23:58: built. Um, and age is an important rank factor.

24:03: I say that age is like the ride height at Disney World, right? You must be at least this tall to ride this ride, but

24:09: if you're 610, it doesn't matter versus you're 49 in. Uh so age is similar and

24:16: that this tall to ride this ride is usually like six to 12 months depending on the space. But once you get older

24:21: than that it becomes less important. That being said um there is evidence

24:27: that chat GPT cares about domain age also. So I will almost never go for a

24:34: new domain unless there's a really really compelling reason to do it.

24:40: for the content planner. Can you have AI get all the info instead of manually copying and pasting? You can sure try.

24:46: Uh but man, AI loves to make up when you give it an opportunity to. Um so every time I've tried to prompt AI to

24:53: do that for me, it makes it up. Um and that's exactly the same reason you'll notice in the content gap analysis, I'm

25:00: feeding AI the screaming frog files. Well, why am I doing that? AI can crawl the website. Okay, it's you give me a

25:07: prompt where the AI is going to give you an accurate answer that it's selfcrolled. I haven't been able to figure that out. It makes up

25:14: because it's I guess too lazy to selfc crawl. Maybe they trained the AI too well and they gave it laziness. Um so

25:21: giving it the screaming frog files, it will actually give real results. And same thing, uh the copy pasting, we'd

25:27: still do that because otherwise it just makes it up. It was It wasn't every

25:32: single time, but it was close to half of the time it was making it up. And it's just like I mean, if it's going to make

25:38: it up half of the time, then I may as well just go copy paste it every time cuz it's not much longer to copy paste

25:45: than it is to double check every time. Um, do you ever set a specific location

25:51: and use Search Console for local keywords? Sure, don't. The only thing we use Search Console for uh on a local

25:56: engagement is to check the uh keep an eye on the index status. Um, that's it. the search console, the data for the GBP

26:03: does not feed into the search console. Uh search console is reporting organic stuff. Uh some of the clickthroughs if

26:09: they click the website button on the GBP, it will show up in search console, but impressions won't. It's just it's

26:16: just a mess. Search console for a local website. So, we don't use it except for the uh indexing report. Uh do your

26:22: clients read the articles you produce and make changes? Some of them do. Um every article we produce, we send to the

26:28: client for feedback before we post it. Um, and some of them read them and give

26:34: us like eighth grade English teacher comments with a red pen, which is no problem. Uh, and some of them write back

26:41: 30 seconds, like we'll send them 20 articles and they'll write back in 30 seconds and say approved. There's like

26:47: either this person is a speedreader or they're not reading them. Either way is fine. Um, when we do get feedback from

26:54: clients, as much as possible, we try to incorporate that feedback back into the custom prompt for that client uh,

27:02: content. So, if they're doing stylistic changes, things like that, then we will change the writing samples and the

27:08: prompt to be the edited versions uh, of what the client has sent back. I mean, our goal is to get to a point with every

27:14: client where even if they're an eighth grade English teacher, they're just not giving us many comments anymore. Um, all

27:21: right. And the last one before we get over to Jay, do you usually put a services link in the navbar? Does it

27:26: matter if I put something like meet Matt instead of about? I don't think it matters if you put something like meet Matt instead of about. Um, I think it's

27:33: pretty clear. I haven't done it, so I I'm not saying that from uh uh evidence,

27:39: but the about us page is really serving two purposes. It's establishing EAT with Google and it is establishing trust with

27:47: the chat GPT recommendation engine. So, I don't think meet Matt would have a significant difference. Um, never tried

27:54: it though. We always just do about. So, I'm just guessing there. So, I'll probably stop talking out loud since I'm

27:59: just guessing. And do you usually put a services link in the navbar? Yes, we usually put a services link in the navbar. Um, depending on the website,

28:08: depending on how competitive it is, uh, sometimes we'll put all of the services in the navbar, sometimes we won't. Um, I

28:15: know I I I talk about that links in the navbar don't pass SEO juice, don't pass

28:21: the internal authority. Not a big deal for a local website because we're trying to rank the GBP, not the individual

28:27: URLs. Uh, so sometimes we do, sometimes we don't. If we're taking over a client's website, which is most common,

28:34: we don't usually build them from scratch. If we're taking over a client website, we usually just go with

28:40: whatever they have. Um, okay. Jay, what you got for me? Thank you very much.

28:46: Sure thing, Matt. Well, you were mentioning copyright

28:52: just earlier. I started copyright, like a professional copyright.

28:58: Oh, yes. Yes. Okay. I have a competitor of mine and

29:03: his city silos are basically one page per city.

29:09: That's it. They do mention all the different services, but I did a

29:16: comparison which I normally do either on cloud and or chat GPT in reference to

29:23: ranking for map packs AI uh overview which is actually visibility

29:31: um mobile readability. So, I get these ratings that help me compare theirs to

29:38: mine. And that c that professional copyright

29:43: on Claude blew me out of the water. Although I have 40 pages

29:50: in that city silo. He had one, but because he was copyritten,

29:56: they said that he really completely blew me out of the water. What's your take on that?

30:02: We very rarely will do competitor analysis um in the local space and the

30:08: reason for that is if every time we've done competitor analysis we basically

30:14: spin out of control. Uh they're always doing something weird or bad and it's

30:19: frustrating, how are they outranking us, etc., etc. We actually stopped doing competitor analysis before we got into

30:26: the local space when we were still doing non-local SEO. Um because the I don't

30:32: know the correct way that a lot of non-local SEOs migrated toward was they

30:37: publish their money page and then they'd start cranking out supporting content for that money page and they'd source

30:43: all of their links to the supporting content and they wouldn't hit the money page with, you know, 200 links or

30:48: whatever. Uh which is the correct way to do it. It's the way that we are doing it also. But the challenge is if you're

30:54: doing a competitor competitive analysis and you're wondering, hey, why isn't my page ranking and you look at the

30:59: competitor's page, he'll have like two links. Well, what you don't see, unless you spend hours doing an analysis, is

31:05: the dozens of internal links that point back up to that money page. Uh so we

31:11: just stop doing it. Um on local, it's even worse. Uh I have seen in many many

31:17: uh fairly competitive spaces, right? They'll number one will will have a thousand reviews and we'll have a domain

31:24: with a 100 indexed URLs. Number two has you know 500 reviews and you know 150

31:32: URLs indexed. And number three has four URLs and no website. Like what the

31:38: How am I supposed to do a competitor analysis on that? Like number three just doesn't fit at all. How is it possibly

31:45: ranking in the top three? It doesn't even have a website attached to it. And the best explanation I've been able to

31:51: come up with and I've heard it from other I don't know SEO people in the space uh remember right that when we

31:58: talk about Google's modern algorithm not the one that Larry Page wrote his PhD dissertation on but how it currently

32:04: works um it's based on goal completion. Google Google's algorithm is set up to

32:10: make its searchers happy so that it searchers come back to Google they use Google etc etc. So, you know, you might

32:17: hear some SEOs talking about dwell time, uh, things like that, right? Uh, if they're if you're trying to optimize for

32:23: dwell time, you're doing it wrong. You need goal completion. Uh, you want to give the searcher what they're looking for as fast as you can so that the

32:29: searcher doesn't go back to search results. So, what that means from a local perspective, goal completion is

32:36: basically making the phone call. So if there's a business and they launched a Google My Business profile 15 years ago

32:44: and in the intervening time uh they've been consistent at answering the phone uh they've provided customer service so

32:51: that customers aren't calling other of the top three ranking then they might just stay in the top three because

32:58: they're providing good goal completion. Customers are interacting well with that business. So Google leaves it there even

33:05: though when you look at the metrics there's no possible explanation for how it's in the top three. Uh so for all of

33:11: those reasons uh we don't focus a huge amount on competitive analysis. The example I just gave 100 indexed URLs 150

33:20: indexed URLs and no website. I would plan on between 130 to 140 URLs if I

33:26: wanted to get into the top three. Uh and that's how I would plan my scope of work. That's how I would do my proposal.

33:31: I would of course keep very close eye on what the local rank map is doing as

33:37: we're cranking out that level of content. So, we have a client uh HVAC in

33:42: South Florida. I think I just mentioned him. And he wants to rank for air conditioning repair in Pompano Beach,

33:49: West Palm Beach, and Orlando by next spring. And his rank map is pretty much 20 plus everywhere. U so that's that's a

33:57: tall ask. Um, so we are doing 80 articles a month between those three

34:03: locations and I chose 80 a month because uh he has five months. That gives me

34:09: enough time to crank out 400 articles between the three locations. That's about 125 130 per location. And that's

34:17: what my very quick how big are these websites looked like we would need in order to rank by March April timeline.

34:25: Now, we're obviously going to watch the local rank maps. And I had this conversation with the client. I was just like, you know, these are all in the

34:31: same domain. And what we're doing is establishing topical relevance. So, we probably don't need 400 pages to

34:36: establish topical relevance. So, we'll keep an eye on the local rank maps. And when we establish topical relevance,

34:42: we'll stop cranking out this topical content and switch to geographical content. But, I don't know for sure. And

34:49: if March is that big of a goal, I'd suggest we start here and then we can re-evaluate December, January. Maybe we

34:56: need to increase the volume if we're not making the progress we need. Maybe we can decrease the volume if things look

35:02: great. I don't know. I hope that was helpful, Jay. I didn't answer your question at all. I was more trying to

35:07: explain why I don't usually ask the question that you asked. Um and and

35:12: sorry for that, but uh fair enough. You don't have a good answer to questions I don't ask. And hopefully I

35:18: explained why I don't usually ask that question. All right, Derek, my good friend Derek, he's been he's been here

35:24: since the OG days. He, Brian, and I there multiple calls. I think it was just the three of us. Anyway, have you

35:30: ever used bark.com? I keep getting random emails saying people are interested in SEO. I haven't used bark.com. Um, and honestly, I can't

35:39: think of anyone off the top of my head that I've heard of using bark.com. Um, so if it works for you, let me know.

35:45: That could be fun to check out. All right, Mr. Ortiz, uh, did you used to play for the Boston

35:51: Red Sox or is that a different David Ortiz? I did. I just slimmed down a little bit.

35:56: Excellent. Excellent. I am brand new to SEO in the group. My first meeting. Welcome, David. Glad to have you. I've

36:02: gone through the SEO course material, looking for advice, how to start marketing, getting someone to do the SEO for me and tell my man, do you have

36:08: marketing advice? Okay, so and and I appreciate it. I love your style in the YouTube videos. Great. Um, so my best

36:14: advice for that, just getting started, how to do the project. So there's a couple of approaches. Um, but they're

36:21: all going to basically revolve around the same thing that I always suggest that someone who's new to SEO do the

36:28: work themselves first. Uh, it's very hard to hire someone to do a job that

36:35: you don't know how to do. Uh, there ends up just being a lot of trust there.

36:40: Whereas hiring someone to do a job that you know how to do, you're much more in control of it. Uh you know how long it

36:47: should take. You have a good idea of what the output should look like, etc., etc., etc. So, for someone new in it, um

36:54: there's there's a couple of options. One, write launch an agency site and do the SEO on your own website. If you

37:00: don't want to do an agency site, no problem. launch some local service business website, use your primary

37:07: residence as the GBP and work to rank that up, right? Um, you could use like a

37:12: plumber, electrician. Those are a little bit challenging because they do require licenses. Uh, so it might be fun to do

37:19: something like pool cleaning or landscaping where there's a fairly high customer value, right? If you're a

37:25: landscaper, like I pay my landscaper $100 a month and I haven't looked for a new landscaper in years because he does

37:31: a great job. Uh so if a landscaper has a very high customer value, uh so does pool cleaning, right? Couple hundred

37:38: bucks a week and uh they'll be your client forever if you do a good job. So these are uh spaces that you don't

37:43: require a license. It's typically not super competitive, especially pool cleaning. Uh and you'll get a chance to

37:50: like build a website, get a GBP verified, like see the whole process through. Another option is uh if you

37:58: find a local business uh and just do it for them for free. Uh maybe they pay the links uh but no labor costs. You do

38:05: everything else for free. Just say that you're new in SEO and uh you want to try try it out and you're wondering if

38:11: they'd be open to it. Just, you know, be honest. A lot of business owners I found are are surprisingly okay with that. Um

38:18: another one is a similar tactic where just like, "Hey, I'm new. Um, I'm looking for like case study type clients

38:24: and I'm not going to charge you anything. Uh, and even to make them more comfortable, you could just literally

38:29: send them uh the invoices, the links to buy the links that you think you want.

38:36: Uh, and then run the Facebook ads campaign that's in the training. Uh, that'll get you on the phone with local

38:41: business owners for $20 or less per call in my experience. Um, and if you do

38:47: that, you know, you get on the phone with these local business owners and you're like, "Hey, I'm really looking

38:52: for a case study client, uh, someone that is okay with me coming in and

38:58: showing off their website as a case study, doing the work. Uh, I might ask you to pay for some links. I'll send you

39:05: to the direct page so you can buy them yourself. You can see I'm not overcharging you, and I won't charge you

39:10: for anything else. And, uh, we'll get you ranked here." So, there's a couple of different ways there that I would be

39:16: approaching if I were brand new. I would say don't do what I did when I was brand new, right? When I didn't know what SEO

39:23: stood for, I started applying to jobs on Upwork for SEO. Um, and one of the first

39:29: clients I got, I told him that I was going to do three PBN links a week.

39:36: Yes. Get out of the frame. I said I was going to do three PBN links per week,

39:42: which I did. And I did that for about two and a half months. And then their entire domain got de-indexed.

39:47: I was just buying the shadyiest, cheapest PBNs I could find. Uh not much

39:52: worse than um getting an entire domain de-index. So don't do that. Okay. Um you

40:01: you can't do much worse than that. All right. Uh oh, Lolita. Excellent. Is she

40:07: here? I think she left. Did she come back? It's so hard to figure out if I Oh, it's

40:13: alphabetical. Excellent. She is here. Okay, perfect. All right, Lita. Some of the competitor have more pages index,

40:18: but they rank lower. Is that because of other factors? Yeah, I talked about this a little bit with Jay. Uh, if you didn't

40:24: catch that answer, um, catch it in the replay. But the short version is Google

40:29: ranks what it wants. And a lot of the weirdness is just going to be based on

40:34: goal completion. How well uh these businesses have done in the past for providing good customer service. Uh

40:42: product schema for a service business would it be service schema? Yes, we will do service schema. Uh service schema

40:47: will go on the GVP landing page and it will be embedded with the uh local

40:52: business schema. Service schema will also go on the category pages and we'll embed all the service schema for the

40:59: services below the category below the category pages and we'll put service schema on the page for that specific

41:06: service. Uh so we basically try to put schema everywhere we possibly can. when you're writing these schemas, uh when

41:12: you're writing the description of these schemas, try to use like real language,

41:18: if that makes sense, not you know formal language like try to use language that

41:23: people use if in a Reddit post looking for an emergency plumber. Uh hopefully that makes sense. Okay, my services and

41:30: categories say review pages with the wibbit is it with widget whibbit is it in those pages I have to add? You can

41:35: add review schema. We typically don't. Uh, if you want to knock yourself out,

41:41: uh, review schema I found just doesn't do very much anymore these days. Years ago, like 10 years ago, it used to do a

41:48: lot, but it just doesn't anymore. Um, breadcrumb crumb schema. Typically, we'll put breadcrumb schema on every

41:54: URL, but we'll just use a plugin like RankMath or something like that to generate the breadcrumb schema. I have

42:00: no idea how to manually generate breadcrumb schema. Um, I just the plugins seem to do a great job with

42:06: that. Uh, all right. And just to confirm what I have in the core 30 organization review, review is optional. FAQ

42:11: services, but uh yes, and you don't have the you could you add author schema uh

42:17: and just call the author the business owner. Uh but that's pretty solid. Uh and to my homepage. Yeah. Uh the local

42:24: business schema, not the location schema. Local business schema on the GBP landing page. Uh blogs and supporting

42:31: organization review FAQ article and bread. Yep. Agreed. If of course you have an FAQ on that page and same thing

42:38: for the core 30 pages. If you have an FAQ then put an FAQ schema on that page.

42:43: Uh how do you search for opportunities where you can suggest the client to put some money on it? I have no idea what

42:48: you're asking Muhammad. Um are you can you say more about this question? Sorry.

42:54: All right Benjamin what you got for me?

43:00: Mute. There we go. Um, well, you kind of rocked my world with the HVAC comment.

43:07: Oh, no. About the uh primary category. So, I initially was going to ask about lead

43:13: snap, but I figured it out. Um, so I have a relatively new site. Like guy didn't have a website and I I searched

43:21: all the competition. I'd say 90% of the market is HVAC contractor. But I I agree with what you're saying.

43:29: Like that's not something that I, you know, if my AC broke, I'm going to search AC repair. If my furnace isn't

43:35: working, I'm going to look for a furnace repair. Yeah. Um I I just was under the impression that, you know, kind of follow what the

43:40: leader is doing so you're not the outlier who's potentially missing out.

43:46: Um, would you recommend since it's, you know, still in its infancy and really

43:54: I don't I don't see it being the end of the world if if I got to reverify and

44:00: restructure the website. Um, what would you say if you were in that situation? What would you do?

44:05: Uh, so you have HVAC contractor chosen as the primary category. Are you ranking for it?

44:11: I am, but he's in such a small community. My next move is to try to build authority and, you know, topical

44:18: relevance in neighboring communities, which aren't very competitive either. Um, so yeah, we're one and two in his

44:24: small community for pretty much every every service that they provide, but

44:29: he's only he only has two other competitors and one of them doesn't have a website. Gotcha. So, um, what I would probably do

44:36: is check how he's ranking for air conditioner repair and if he's ranking well for it, then I'd just leave it alone.

44:42: Okay. I mean, my thought is I haven't built out the full core 30 um for those

44:47: secondary because I have those and if he's ranking well, then there's no need to. All right. Yeah, because I have air

44:52: conditioner contractor, air conditioning repair service, heating contractor, furnace repair service. Those are my

44:58: secondary categories and then services. I just need to create the service pages and and build more authority.

45:06: Perfect. Perfect. Um I think that was it. Awesome. All right. Brian had a question

45:14: on your HVAC example. I have a large HVAC contractor and that's a primary category. Excellent. Last year I quickly made them number one. Great. They paused

45:20: a contract to rebuild their website. Rankings tanked. Yep. And it's been a

45:26: struggle to get them back. Do you think the primary category is not the problem when it wasn't before? I'm going to dig a little deeper on the competitors. So,

45:32: I mean I something similar to to Benjamin. It's probably not the primary category without looking at it because

45:38: you had it ranked before. Um, how long ago is the rebuild? Was it recent or uh

45:45: like months ago and they haven't gotten back yet? The rebuild was uh last summer, not not

45:52: I mean a year ago. And so then they were expanded to some other locations which we talked about

45:58: that like last yeah months ago. So I was focused a lot of time on those other

46:03: locations. Honestly, I just figured they'd go back to number one like they were before, you know, with a little bit

46:09: of time once they recovered. Uh, and that hasn't happened. So,

46:14: while it's been a year, you're doing this the right stuff to be doing it. You're not seeing a lot of progress. Probably what

46:22: I would do is a technical audit of the site, uh, if you haven't already, just to see, you know, when they launch the

46:29: website, is there a mistake? Do they have errors in it? Is Google seeing what it's supposed to be seeing, crawling

46:34: what they're supposed to be seeing? Um, all of that. That's what I would uh that's where I would probably go uh to

46:41: look at it. Um, and I don't know. I So, changing the primary category is also

46:46: going to have a major impact on rankings. So, I'd also like, hey, how are they ranking for air conditioner

46:51: repair? What are the competitors using? Um cuz I mean if they're if they're like

46:57: five, six, seven average rank position and you switch to air conditioning repair, you might lose even more ground.

47:05: Yeah. I went through the site just to make sure that the web design company didn't completely screw us over because

47:12: they that's what they had been doing. Yeah. And uh so we kind of got everything touched up and fixed up and you know

47:18: again I just figured hey you know we were there before we'll get right back. year is longer than I would expect.

47:24: Yeah, feels like something else is going on. Uh yeah, so I'm going through it like the

47:30: last couple days. Uh all of their services and we had another bonus. All

47:35: of their categories, subcategories were erased. Nobody knows why. No one can

47:40: explain. No one can claim who took out all of their secondary categories.

47:46: So you know the when they did that, we lost everything. We were doing well for

47:51: plumbing as a secondary category gone because somebody got rid of them and no

47:56: one knows who. We put them all back. Plumbing uh responded to that and now I'm kind of rebuilding from that. What

48:02: happened also is Google took all of the services and shoved them up into HVAC

48:08: contractor because it wasn't the secondary service categories anymore.

48:13: Yeah. yet stop changing things on the on the

48:19: website on the GBP if you're ranking. Um yeah. Uh I mean that that's that's how I would

48:26: basically um that's how I would basically approach it. And Troy also pointed out like Lead Snap does let you

48:32: lock so that you can only make those changes through Lead Snap. You can't actually make those changes through the

48:37: GBP anymore. Uh, we block pretty much every client's GVP to make sure, wait,

48:44: who made this change to make sure that doesn't happen because the clients don't have access to log into Lead Snap and

48:49: make them themselves. Uh, but yeah, that's frustrating. Um,

48:54: well, they have about a dozen people in that management on that. Yeah. So, definit somebody just did it

49:00: by accident, I would guess. So, just just lock it so it doesn't happen again. Uh, put everything back the way it was

49:06: and depending on where they're ranking, right? If they're ranking 30 40% in the top three, then it's geographical

49:13: content to try to get it back. If it's below 30 to 40% in the top three, then they need more topical relevance and

49:18: that's adding FAQs and people also ask questions and all all of the jazz like that. Uh if the they're ranking well for

49:26: AC repair, you can change your primary category. If they're not, I don't know. I' I'd have to look at the ranking to

49:33: decide if I would actually make that change or not. Um but yeah. All right, Brian asks Facebook

49:39: ads question referring to the old method. So the old method, that's the one on the training. It's the one that relies on a sales call. How many ad

49:46: creatives images do you typically test? Well, so for the it's funny for the one

49:51: that's in the Facebook uh for the one that's in the uh training, the first

49:57: creative, the first image, and the first primary text uh won. Uh tried split testing.

50:04: None of the other ones could beat that one. So, we just left the first one going. Um, typically we will split test

50:12: quite a bit, but we're we're looking at So, are the ads the problem? Is the

50:17: funnel the problem? Or is the call the problem? So, with that particular campaign, all we were doing is trying to

50:23: get them on the phone call, which is a much easier ask than trying to get them to pay for anything. So, the big challenge there was the phone call. Um,

50:31: so that's where we had to play with the offer, with the contract, with the price point, etc., etc. before it could start

50:37: to get closes. Um, I don't really pay attention to all the metrics that Facebook gives. Um, maybe that's bad,

50:45: but really what I'm looking for is the cost per lead. Uh, and then cost per

50:52: call if there is a call and cost per customer uh, at at the trailing end. I'm

50:59: not looking at things like click-through rate, blah, blah, blah. I'm I'm assuming that Facebook's algorithm is smart

51:05: enough to optimize around stuff like that where I'm just saying, "Hey, what's my cost per lead?" Uh, for B2B

51:12: uh with a phone number, five bucks is pretty good. Uh, less than that is better, of course. And, uh, if you're

51:19: running like more than $10, then your, uh, offer in the ad is bad. And I mean,

51:26: obviously, it's good if the ad offer matches the offer you're actually making, but it is two different things. the offer you actually make and the

51:32: offer that's in the ad. So, yeah. Um, okay. How long do you run the ad? So,

51:37: typically we'll run the ad until we get three times the ad spend of whatever we're trying to make happen. So, if we

51:44: don't have any leads yet and I'm trying to get like a $5 cost per lead, then I'll run $15. If I haven't had a lead

51:51: with $15 in ad spend, I know the ad's not working. A new ad, new copy, new

51:56: offer. uh my if my if I'm trying to get a customer acquisition for a h 100red

52:01: bucks, then I'll run $300 worth of ads before I decide it's not working. Uh

52:07: three times the expected value is the statistical significance. If the actual

52:12: expected value is correct and you run three times that value, there's like a 99.9%

52:18: chance you would have had an event happen um just based on how uh

52:24: statistical curves work. So 3x is the rule that we use. Uh are you keeping

52:29: targeting as broad as possible? We're using as broad as possible. Um when we

52:35: ran the plumbing ad, it was people who are interested in water heaters. That was the only interest we put in. That

52:40: was it. Um and again, uh Facebook knows its audience better than I do. The more

52:46: you narrow down an audience, typically the more expensive it's going to get uh

52:53: with running those ads. So, I like to leave it super broad. Um, and then let

52:58: it run for a couple of days until Facebook decides who needs to see it and then Facebook will narrow it down. Um,

53:05: hopefully that makes sense. All right, let's go to Is it Karan?

53:14: Yep, that's me, man. That's me all the way from New Zealand. Say it again. New Zealand.

53:19: From New Zealand. New Zealand, man. I was up at 6:00 a.m. But it's all right. 6 a.m. All right. All right.

53:26: About 7 o'clock now for me. So, let's take a quick poke. We're gonna run Mel Electric.

53:34: Yeah. Macau Electric. Macau Electric. That's the one there, man. Yep. And then let it run.

53:42: All right. Uh, so I hate your title tag because your title

53:47: tag is just the brand name. Typically, we want the title tag to match the primary service we're trying to rank

53:53: for. Um, so that's that's that's my first comment. And let's see if I can

53:59: find your 06. Let's see if I can find your GBP. Uh, if the phone numbers

54:04: match, that should find it. I don't see your GBP.

54:11: Um, so let's see. Then we'll try just searching

54:16: for the business name. Mel electric. There it is. There. Oh, so that's the one. Okay. So,

54:22: the the name is different on the GBP versus the website. All right. All right. And the phone number is also

54:29: different. 646345 4183. No, it's the same phone number. I

54:34: wonder why Google couldn't find it. Um, that is Oh,

54:41: so this starts with 64. So, that's the New Zealand country code or something. So, that's why. Yep. All right. Okay. Okay. So, I'm

54:48: still It's still weird. It didn't find it. It should have found it. No problem. Um,

54:54: so yeah, I'm still not happy with the What am I looking for? Heat map new.

54:59: Still not happy with the uh title tag. Yep.

55:05: Yeah, because I haven't done the core 30 yet just started this course. But um so the title tag isn't part of the core

55:11: 30, right? The title tag is uh just part of the GBP landing page

55:16: audit. Uh probably not the one maintenance and electrical. Sorry,

55:22: can't find city. Boy, I've never tried to run uh something in New Zealand. Uh

55:29: Wan Ganui. Monganui. Yep. Small town.

55:34: Oh, there you go. This one. Search.

55:39: And we've found it. Excellent. And electrician is your primary category. Great. So, I'll do keywords.

55:48: Normally, I would do the city name, but I don't feel like typing that again. So, I'll just do near me, but that's wrong.

55:53: Just so you know, city name is the typical one I would do.

55:59: Um, this will update. I know you had more than zero. So, your primary category is electrician. So, your title

56:05: tag should be something like electrician Wangui. And if I look at your page

56:11: source, boy, that's a mess. No problem. Then your uh title tag or your H1 tag is

56:19: Yeah. Uh so you also want exact match, primary category, city name in your H1. So this

56:27: is your H1. I would also change that. Um there's no GVP embed. So I would make

56:34: sure that you get a GVP embed. This is basically just a lot of the

56:40: initial checks that we do for the uh a brand new client type website.

56:46: Yeah. Oh, that's weird. Yeah, I did try to do that last night. It wasn't working.

56:54: All right, no problem. I don't know why.

57:05: So, it looks like there's no Oh, man. I'm not going to go through 270. My

57:11: quick check implies that there's uh no schema on this homepage. I don't know

57:17: why this isn't working. Um that is very unusual. A code 200.

57:23: It is indexed at least. So, that's positive. 46. Um but okay, where are we on the heat

57:29: map? All right. So, not awful. Get out of here. Um, we we we got some solid

57:35: ranking right at your address and then it just drops off fairly quickly. So, your top 3% and of course this is

57:42: including a bunch of stuff out in the water. So, I' I'd adjust that obviously and and rerun it, but our top 3% were at

57:49: 22. So, not bad. Um, and my guess is once you make some of the title tag, H1

57:56: changes, make sure there's local business schema, embed the GBP, you might see your top 3% click up into the

58:03: 30 to 40% range just from that. Um, the other thing that I would

58:08: probably do, you have photos coming soon. Uh, so I'd get rid of that, right? We it's not like 1995. We don't need to say

58:16: like under construction on websites. Uh, so we can get rid of that. Um, you know,

58:21: get the damn photos. If you don't have any photos, then generate some with AI. It should take 5 minutes. Uh, you have

58:27: some photos of the company vehicles with logos. Uh, I know there are a bunch of AI tools that you can give those logos,

58:33: company vehicles, and have it generate new images that use those same, uh, logos and everything. Uh, so do that.

58:40: Get some images on there. Um, there's a ton of stuff. So, the so that's

58:45: basically where I'd start. Then I would um do the GBP audit. Uh obviously I I

58:51: didn't do the full GB I didn't really do much of anything in the GBP audit, but do the GBP audit and then run the

58:58: content gap analysis just to get an idea of what type of content should their

59:03: site have versus what it does have and start working your way through that core 30. But keep an eye on your rank map. Um

59:10: because your rank map isn't terrible, right? Um 22% in the top three. Sadly, a

59:16: lot of that is out in the water as I'm looking at the rank map. If I got rid of the water, your percent top three would

59:22: probably be more like three or 4%. Um,

59:28: but you know, your number one competitor is 90% top three. Your number two

59:33: competitor is 92% in the top three. That's kind of funny. They're sorted by average rank by default. So, the number

59:40: two by average rank has a higher percent top three. often when we see like one or

59:45: two businesses just dominating the top three like that, uh that's a sign that the competition is low, right? If if I

59:54: run this rank map and I see there are five businesses and they each have 30% top three, uh then that's typically sign

1:00:01: that the competition is very high. Uh because you have a lot of websites that are fighting over it. This one the

1:00:06: competition looks relatively low just because you have two businesses that are completely dominating. That gives me a

1:00:13: lot of hope that in a few months building out the core 30, fixing the GBP

1:00:18: landing page issues that we talked about, uh, you can make some real significant movement in the average rank

1:00:25: position. Uh, this business, Markeel Electric, I wouldn't because they're in New Zealand, but if they're in the

1:00:30: United States and I ran this rank map, I'd be happy to take them on as a client because I know that uh, it doesn't it

1:00:37: won't take a lot of SEO work to have real results for them. Um, hopefully that was helpful. I didn't do like a

1:00:43: full-on deep dive, but that's that's where I'd start with the broad brush strokes.

1:00:51: Oh, and Karen, it looks froze. So, we'll come back to him maybe in a little bit.

1:00:56: Uh, let's see. Matt asks, "When would you use your SC rejects?" Sorry, you're lagging out.

1:01:02: Yeah. Filters versus AI prompt for authority. So CTR analysis prompt, we

1:01:08: don't really use that for for uh local. Uh it doesn't really do much for local because we're not trying to optimize

1:01:14: CTR. Everything is based on the GBP. I honestly don't know what SC reets

1:01:19: rejects filters means. So I have no idea. Okay. Oh, Muhammad, thank you for clarifying. I was saying, how do you

1:01:26: search for opportunities where you can suggest a client to put money on it for? Oh, there's a prompt in the training for

1:01:32: uh local offsite where you run the prompt, you make sure research mode is ticked on. Uh chat GPT calls it deep

1:01:38: research. You can do it either way. Um and then uh it will basically output a

1:01:45: sorted list of events you can sponsor. Chamber of Commerce is almost always going to be the first event and beyond

1:01:51: that it's just hey, which ones look good? uh which ones are relatively low cost and come from you know so like I I

1:01:57: talked about the TEDex sponsorship that was I think I think it was $250 I can't remember if it's $250 or 500 um but it's

1:02:04: a very high authority.edu edu local university that's that what you would

1:02:09: get the link from that's a very powerful link uh so that's definitely worth it um

1:02:14: okay and lolita yeah I went through the schema fast okay so we do service schema on the category

1:02:22: page for each service right so you have your category and then you on the GBP you're going to list all the services

1:02:27: below that category right so typically on the category page we're also going to

1:02:33: have little paragraphs with 20 30 you know 70 words of content for each one of

1:02:39: those uh paragraphs. Uh so yes we would put schema for the category and then we

1:02:45: put a bunch of nested schema for all the services that are under that category. Those services are also going to be

1:02:51: mentioned on the onpage content itself. Um so yeah hopefully that makes a little

1:02:56: bit more sense. Troy, yes, thank you. I talked about that. You're absolutely right. GBP embed uh there's a Google

1:03:03: support doc for it. uh how to embed GBP on website Google um

1:03:11: here. So anyway, you can do the search that you're looking for support.google

1:03:17: um domain and it's super easy. When you log into a GBP, uh you can just

1:03:22: literally grab an embed code and paste it onto your WordPress site or whatever site as custom code and the GBP will

1:03:29: appear on there. It's awesome. Uh awesome, Matt. Glad you could make it. You probably left already. No problem.

1:03:34: Um Karen, yeah, absolutely. Keep me up to date with it. Uh I'm I'm excited about that client. That one that one

1:03:40: looks really good. Um the only reason I don't take clients outside the United States. I used to and it's always a mess

1:03:47: because I'm sure you you know this Karen uh I've taken clients in the UK uh and

1:03:53: it never works well because when I write local content uh in American English, it

1:04:00: doesn't perform very well on a site based in the United Kingdom. So yeah, um

1:04:07: same thing with the new New Zealand client. So uh we don't take those on. All right, Billy, how you doing, man?

1:04:13: What you got for me? I you got kicked off so you had to come back on. Yeah. Frustrating. Anyway, what you got?

1:04:19: I I actually didn't get kicked off. I had to jump on another call real quick. So, but anyway, I'm back. Uh yeah, I I

1:04:27: maybe I need to buy a Val here. I'm not sure. But, uh is there a separate call to find out what's going on with the

1:04:32: Facebook ads or Oh, the 10K challenge. Yeah. So, and those I did one yesterday. Uh all the

1:04:39: recordings I always post in and they aren't scheduled in advance. I could not think of a way to schedule them advance.

1:04:46: Sometimes it's just like, "Oh man, I got to make some changes to this ad. I said I would do everything live and on

1:04:51: camera, so let me just post in the school group that I'm going to go live and make changes to the ads." Uh, that's

1:04:57: part of my challenge that I don't really know when I need to go when I need to do

1:05:03: things because it's actually running ads like, you know, for real's like it's I'm

1:05:08: not faking anything. So yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Got it. I guess I'm I'm curious as to what's going on with it and how it's progressing and and and

1:05:15: whether you're getting calls and making any money or what's up with it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, uh real quick

1:05:21: overview. Um we I I have three sales that have come through. The funnel does

1:05:28: not use ads or sorry ads. The funnel does not use any calls. Um so there's

1:05:33: been no calls. I had three sales come through. Uh I had a fairly sizable setup

1:05:39: error that I made on day one. Um I had the Facebook lead form and then

1:05:45: integrated that with high level. But after you do that integration, you then

1:05:50: need to do a form mapping to map the fields from the Facebook lead form. Y

1:05:56: um Highle used to uh not let you use a form that wasn't that wasn't

1:06:04: fieldmapped. Now they do, but if you use a form that isn't fieldmapped, uh, high

1:06:10: level doesn't get any of the contacts. Like just none of them are imported in. Uh, so I did have two sales when that

1:06:16: was going on. And I'm thinking that's probably the issue why those sales weren't tracked properly and high level

1:06:22: because the form fill mapping was broken. Had a third sale come in after

1:06:27: that had happened. Uh, so I was at uh I haven't checked today, but I was at

1:06:32: about $400 in ad spend and the offer is $147 a month. So I had three come in.

1:06:39: That's $441. So money positive and not including fulfillment costs. So that's cool. Um,

1:06:47: but the performance of the the original funnel was either lead form or squeeze

1:06:53: page is step one. Uh, video sales letter step two. Uh, sign up is step three. And

1:06:58: then onboarding is step four. The video sales letter was performing horrible. So

1:07:04: I redid the video sales letter, new script, re-recorded it, put the new one on there. The new one did just as bad.

1:07:11: Uh so I was just like, "All right, let's get rid of the sales letter entirely." So now I'm running a three-step funnel

1:07:17: where squeeze page lead form step one, signup page step two. And I do have like

1:07:23: a 30 second video where it says like, "Hey, I'm Caleb." that is on the signup page, but that's it. Uh, and then, um,

1:07:30: the onboarding is step three. So, a simpler funnel. Um, and I changed the

1:07:36: email follow-up sequence. Now, the email follow-up sequence addresses the primary objections that I think somebody would

1:07:42: have to buy this offer. Uh, I made those changes yesterday, so I don't know. I

1:07:48: don't have enough information to say how all that is going so far. Um, but I need

1:07:53: 69 clients to hit 10K. Uh, today is day 12 and I have three. So, making

1:07:59: progress. Making progress. Um, okay. Yeah. Cool. Cool. So, I'm not sure if that was

1:08:07: my my only question. I had another question, but that was a public service. We won't count that one because you got

1:08:12: me to plug the uh the the the thing I'm doing. Yeah. No, I want to know all about it because I'm I'm so tired doing sales calls. I do

1:08:19: sales calls all the time and I'm just don't want to do them anymore. Sales calls suck.

1:08:24: Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. I'm trying to stop. So, I have a I know Lalita, I think her

1:08:30: name was, she she asked some questions on the linking. And so, I have some questions on the linking to an internal

1:08:36: linking. Okay. So, let's suppose you have a secondary category of house cleaning service. Okay, you with me? And

1:08:43: then under that we have service pages. Porch cleaning, roof cleaning, house

1:08:48: washing, siding cleaning, and we have links from the secondary category page down to the service niche pages. You

1:08:55: with me so far? Right. Okay. Got it. Now, do I also put a link back

1:09:01: on my porch cleaning or my service niche clean putting in, hey, house cleaning, linking back to the house cleaning also?

1:09:08: So, I give them more authority. So, hey, that's a secondary page. Do I link back to that or just link to it and don't

1:09:14: link back? Does that make sense? Gener I think what I think so generally

1:09:19: we'll link up and down. Okay, perfect. That's a that's what I wanted to hear. Link up up and down both

1:09:25: ways. Yep. Perfect. Okay. Yeah. I'm not sure if anyone else had that question, but that's kind of important thing to know.

1:09:31: Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We'll almost always link up and down all the time. Yep. Yep. Got it. Thank you. Perfect.

1:09:37: Awesome. All right. Any other questions? Did I get through all of them in

1:09:44: in that amount of time? No other questions. Anything else? Billy, your hand's still

1:09:49: up. You're the only one. I got lots of questions. I'll keep on going. Okay. So So I I would like to ask another if I

1:09:56: could. Dave, you jump in. I'll go in after you. How's that? Thank you very much. So um so that's an

1:10:03: awesome idea about putting up an agency website. So, my actual background is I'm

1:10:10: a former financial adviser who wrote an article on AI that exploded and I turned it into an AI consulting business for

1:10:17: adviserss. Nice. Um, I'm also a chef. I was known as the financial chef because I was a financial

1:10:23: adviser. I had a mobile office with a kitchen and I would cook for my clients while I was giving them money advice. My

1:10:30: tag my tagline is I I cook everything but the books. Um, I am I am relocating

1:10:36: to Europe. So, uh going to uh uh Madrid, Spain, and I'm setting this up. I'm

1:10:43: currently in Jacksonville. So, I'm a very uh systematic type of person. So,

1:10:49: is there a guide through the website as to like what courses to do? And because

1:10:55: actually going through the SEO course was way advanced for me. My eyes and my a my ADHD was glazed over. So, is there

1:11:04: more of like a processing step to be able to to ease into this? And Richie

1:11:10: has been part of the group that I'm in and he's he's been amazing. Yeah. So, um I mean really we tried to

1:11:18: design the course to be as simple as possible. Um it's really just hey let's

1:11:25: start we'll build the website. Um I mean I guess it's interesting to hear that

1:11:31: feedback. uh if you have you know the feedback that you have on how we can make it better you know let me know uh

1:11:38: okay I'm definitely interested in that of course uh we we often make changes to the to the course and in an effort to

1:11:45: improve it make it better um but I guess you know to just break it down really

1:11:52: when we talk about uh local SEO uh we're

1:11:58: trying to rank the GVP so basically we're going to build a website uh because the GBP is linked to the

1:12:04: website. So the local SEO, the way Google's algorithm works, uh there's three factors that Google's algorithm is

1:12:11: looking at for local SEO. Okay, the first one is proximity. Uh how far away

1:12:17: is the searcher from your business address? Okay, obviously there's nothing

1:12:22: we can do about proximity uh short of uh unmarked vans. Not a good way to try to

1:12:27: grow your business. So, moving on to way number two. And that's why when I pulled

1:12:33: the local rank map up for the electrician in New Zealand, you saw that it was ranked 1 2 3 very, very close and

1:12:40: then it quickly dropped off. That's a very common pattern that we see. Um, and what we're trying to do in local SEO

1:12:47: very simply is turn those one, twos, and threes that are on the address to one, twos, and threes as we get farther and

1:12:53: farther away. Um, that's the goal, right? That's that when we do that, we have success. Is that a

1:13:00: big measure of success? The measure of success is how far away from the GBP address is the rank map

1:13:08: green. That's all we're trying to do. We're trying to turn the rank map green as we get farther and farther away. So,

1:13:13: we know proximity is always going to be against us because we're trying to turn it green far away. So, the other two

1:13:19: factors are relevance and trust. So, relevance I break into two

1:13:24: categories. topical relevance and geographical relevance. So when we talk about topical relevance, basically we're

1:13:31: trying to teach Google, which is just math, we're trying to teach Google's algorithm that you provide that service,

1:13:38: right? That you provide plumbing services, you provide roofing services, you provide electrical services,

1:13:43: whatever it happens to be. And we know that we have topical relevance when we see that you're green close to your GBP

1:13:53: address. So, you've heard me say your top 3%, that's the core metric we watch. What percent of that map is the top

1:13:59: three. When we get that top 3% to 30 to 40%. Which is pretty low, right? That's

1:14:05: that's pretty tight on the GBP to only have 30 to 40%. That means that we have

1:14:10: enough topical relevance. We've taught Google that we're a plumber. And Google is now showing us for people who are

1:14:17: searching for a plumber, even if they're two miles away. So, we have the topical relevance. Google trustworth plumber.

1:14:23: Then we move on to building geographical relevance. And that is showing Google, hey, I do plumbing 10 miles away. I do

1:14:31: plumbing 5 miles away. I do plumbing seven miles away down here. So to do that, we're going to produce specific

1:14:37: content for each one of those dots to try to turn it from a six into a five,

1:14:42: from a five into a four, and then eventually from a four into a three. Uh so that's where we start producing geographical content to make those

1:14:49: specific dots turn green. Uh the third factor that Google looks at is trust and

1:14:56: trust is just a code word. Uh it means how your external links. So when we talk

1:15:02: about joining the chamber of commerce or sponsoring the youth softball league or sponsoring the local TEDex or whatever

1:15:08: it happens to be those types of sponsorships uh give you links back to

1:15:14: your website. Those links Google reads as trust. Hey, you know, David's

1:15:20: website, they're a member of the Chamber of Commerce and they sponsored the nine-year-old girls softball team. Uh,

1:15:25: those are both big things for local business to do. Builds a lot of trust. So, I'm going to rank him farther and

1:15:31: farther away because I trust him more. He has these high authority websites vouching for him in terms of those

1:15:36: links. Uh, so that's fundamentally what we're trying to do. We build enough trust, we build enough topical

1:15:42: relevance, then we build the geographical relevance to turn the whole map green. I don't know. Was that

1:15:47: helpful trying to break it down on that level? That that was amazing. Like that all of a sudden my mind went now I get it right

1:15:54: in understanding that. Um so in building my own agency website um because I'm

1:16:00: transient here would I put like I have a temporary address and I guess I'm I

1:16:06: don't really care. I'm just looking I I I guess I shouldn't care about six

1:16:11: months from now if I'm using this to just teach myself. Correct. any address and any GBP that that I can get myself

1:16:19: listed for. If I'm in a rental apartment for four months, do I do my my Google

1:16:24: business listing there and and then, you know, just try and rank myself and see

1:16:29: what happens to teach myself this? Absolutely. And um remember, right, we I

1:16:36: said that proximity is a significant rank factor. So, the closer your GBP is

1:16:42: to the searchers, the easier it is to rank. Another way to phrase that is the more GBPs you have, the easier it is to

1:16:49: rank because if you have five GBPs all around the city, suddenly your proximity is much lower. So if you have a

1:16:56: temporary uh rental, temporary place you're staying and you can get a verified GBP there, there's a whole

1:17:03: course in the a whole separate classroom of how to get a verified GBP. Man,

1:17:08: that's awesome. Do it. Get the GBP verified. If you leave that place in in a month, 2 months, 3 months, whatever,

1:17:15: no problem. Don't tell Google, "Keep the GBP open." At some point, one of your

1:17:20: competitors will probably complain that you don't actually have a location

1:17:25: there, and that GBP will likely get suspended. And at that point, you you

1:17:31: might have to actually get an office space or rent another apartment or something else to get that GBP

1:17:36: reverified, get that suspension lifted. Uh, but until that happens, man, GBPs

1:17:42: are good. Get GBPs. Uh, the I see no problem with GBP overlap, Jay. I mean,

1:17:48: why would I care if if I have two GBPs and they're overlapping, who cares? The one closer to the searcher is the one

1:17:53: that's going to rank higher. It makes tracking the local rank maps harder, but I mean, I'm not going to complain about

1:17:59: that, right? That's what we do as an SEO agency. Um, yeah. Is that helpful with the GBPs?

1:18:06: Yes. Thank you very much. I'm happy to be part of the group. Awesome. Great having you, David. Uh,

1:18:11: Google says, "What's illegal?" GBP overlap. You can speak. You can unmute yourself, Jay. Uh,

1:18:22: say it again. Sorry. Uh, yeah, the G the GBP overlap.

1:18:28: I was reading that they'll suspend you if it if you have two GBPs that are close enough to overlap in your area.

1:18:36: Yeah. So that's if the uh service area overlaps and the service area is this

1:18:43: little box on the GBP that doesn't really mean anything if that makes sense. No.

1:18:50: So when you fill out your GBP, one of the boxes in the GBP is what your

1:18:55: service uh what your service area is. So you can just fill it out so that they each have separate service areas.

1:19:02: Okay. So it does you do have to worry about overlap there. just on the GBP.

1:19:08: Yeah. And I wouldn't worry about Now, it it does also say that you're not allowed to have duplicate listings and blah blah

1:19:13: blah. So, we're not really doing duplicate listings. We'd call it a multilocation business.

1:19:19: Yeah. And you were mentioning external links

1:19:25: that link back like the Chamber of Commerce. Do those have to be the Chamber of

1:19:33: Commerce links back into you, the external links back to you? Do they have to be follow or

1:19:40: because all my chambers around here do not have follow. They're all no follow.

1:19:45: Oh, that's weird. Um, so usually, uh, we'll check that and if it's a no follow

1:19:52: link, I'm less excited about joining, uh, because it's going to be less impactful. It's still going to be

1:19:58: impactful. It's still going to be good, but less than a do follow.

1:20:06: And then I don't hear Billy jumping in. So, I'm gonna ask another one until Billy does jump in. Billy, you got anything,

1:20:12: man? I'm jumping. Go ahead and do one more. I'm here to jump. Keep going, Jay. One more.

1:20:19: Okay. I tried to GBP my home for a home

1:20:25: office. And I'm just now reading in the whatever it is on Google that they will

1:20:33: not allow home offices anymore to be on a on a it has to be a service area

1:20:39: business only. Have you heard anything about that? No. I mean they they allow GBPs to be

1:20:46: verified at a primary residence. Yeah. According to Google, they're not now because I I can't get mine to be

1:20:53: I've been trying for four weeks now and I still can't get them to verify it.

1:21:00: I haven't seen anything. I mean, even looking at now, so it's saying that the correct way to do it is a service area

1:21:05: business, but you don't need to choose service area business. I would probably uh ask what your

1:21:13: GBP verification video looks like. you might be having trouble getting it verified because of issues with the verification video. I mean, this was as

1:21:20: recently as a few months ago that we were verifying GBPs at primary residences. Uh, don't do a service area

1:21:27: business. You can't rank service area businesses. I wasn't a very hard service if I had

1:21:33: to. Thank you, Billy. No problem. So, so I question on the

1:21:39: FAQs and and if I got it right, you're only doing FAQs for onethird of your

1:21:45: pages. How do you determine what those one-third pages are? For example, you do it for the main page. I imagine you're

1:21:51: doing with FAQs for your secondary category pages, but yeah, so we'll do it for the the primary pages that are part of the core 30 and

1:21:58: then beyond that, just based on what um Got it. what the what the rank map shows.

1:22:05: That's what I mean. So all my all my uh uh core 30 pages should have FAQs. Is

1:22:10: that right? Most of them. But when so and when I say the the primary core 30, I'm really

1:22:16: talking about the primary and secondary category pages and then a couple of service pages that you really really

1:22:21: care about. Got it. Okay. So So uh I guess I'm trying to figure out why wouldn't you

1:22:28: just put FAQs on everything? If that helps you with chat GPT and it helps you with AI overview and all the other

1:22:35: stuff, why wouldn't you just do that? I mean, I'm I'm just curious. Yeah, because

1:22:41: um so just because I don't want every

1:22:47: single page on the domain to look the same. Got it. Okay. Right. I just want some var variability

1:22:54: in in what I have. Okay. Got it. So you'll put on some

1:23:00: service categories, uh, all the secondary C, all the secondary, the primaries, and then mix it up.

1:23:07: Exactly. Cool. Okay. Thanks, Carlin. You're up.

1:23:14: Um, I posted my question um in the chat.

1:23:20: Oh, in the chat. Oh, there we go. Um, oh, uh, so I only

1:23:28: have four minutes until I got to go. Uh, but we can we can see what we can get done in four minutes. Let's let's bang

1:23:34: it out. Um, his, uh, GBP is ranking really well for

1:23:40: a big part of Fort Wayne, but I want to expand it to a different part of Fort

1:23:45: Wayne. Okay. So often with stuff like that to

1:23:52: expand to a different uh city or region, we are often going to need a new GBP.

1:24:01: And he is in is he in Fort Wayne, Indiana? Did you say Fort Wayne? He's His address is um Greyel, Indiana,

1:24:11: which is like a small suburb outside of Fort Wayne, Indiana.

1:24:19: Good vibes ebike tours. What the Can't find. What's the city name again?

1:24:25: Uh, Greyel. G R A B I L L.

1:24:30: Greyel, Indiana.

1:24:36: There we go. Top one. There we go.

1:24:45: So here I'm doing the near me search on purpose because you said your goal is to rank in Fort Wayne. So if I did a

1:24:51: concrete contractor Greyel, you wouldn't rank in Fort Wayne at all.

1:24:56: And boy, Fort Wayne is far. So this map isn't even going to show Fort Wayne. So

1:25:02: you're trying to rank him all the way down in Fort Wayne, huh? I he's already like half of Fort Wayne

1:25:10: or or a big chunk of Fort Wayne. I've already got him there. Um but I want to kind of expand towards Brierwood Hills

1:25:16: and if I if it's possible. You're getting really far away. So I

1:25:21: don't know how competitive Fort Wayne is. Uh I'm surprised you're able to rank all the way that far out anyway. Uh if

1:25:28: he had asked, "Hey, I want to rank in Fort Wayne." I would probably say, "Get yourself a GBP in Fort Wayne and then

1:25:33: let's talk. like the farther away you get and the

1:25:38: most common issue is that they're in a small suburb and they want to rank in a major city. That just gets really hard

1:25:46: uh as it gets farther and farther away. Um yeah.

1:25:51: So you'd recommend a multi- location business then generally for that for that. Now, if

1:25:58: you're already ranking really well in Fort Wayne and you have a couple of spots that are like fours and fives that

1:26:03: you're trying to turn, then I would probably just do geographic based content there and see maybe you can get them to turn. Uh that would just be a

1:26:09: sign that there aren't very many concrete contractors in that area. Uh but as soon as there's more concrete

1:26:15: contractors that Google can find, I mean, if you're 25 miles away or end in

1:26:21: a different city, it's just gets very difficult to outrank them. Okay. It's um the area I'm trying to

1:26:28: rank for is more of the or there's a lot of wellto-do homeowners down there, which is why um I'm trying. So, okay.

1:26:35: Thanks for the help. Yeah, sure. All right. Uh let's see, couple more quick ones. Alita asked,

1:26:40: "What does it mean no follow?" So, a no follow means that you don't get any SEO authority from the link, and a follow

1:26:47: link means you do get SEO authority. So, I wouldn't worry about it too much. You

1:26:53: can see it if you look at the source code of the website or if you have a plug-in installed that shows you. Uh

1:26:59: I'll often join a chamber of commerce even if it is no follow just because the chamber link is just that powerful. Um

1:27:07: so yeah um hopefully that makes sense. Um and 230 Tim hope you have a quick

1:27:14: one. What you got Tim?

1:27:20: Can you hear me? Yeah, Tim, you uh just just Okay, you see the house

1:27:25: cleaning. I put it over in the uh chat. I see it. So, those are packages they offer. Would

1:27:31: I want to have those keywords directly connected underneath the package or

1:27:37: directly to the house cleaning services category? Sorry, I'm having trouble hearing you.

1:27:44: Volume up. Yes.

1:27:54: What? What? Can you say it again?

1:27:59: All right. Well, that's good for that then. Um, all right. Well, thank you very much for coming, everyone. As

1:28:06: always, we are here next Tuesday. Uh, that will be 16th. Uh, thank you very

1:28:13: much for coming. Hopefully, we'll see you next Tuesday. In the interim, feel free post in the school group. Uh send

1:28:19: me a message and keep your eyes on the school community. As I told Billy, I

1:28:24: will uh often be going live in the next couple of weeks with very short notice to do some work on the 10K challenge

1:28:31: stuff. Um so yeah, thank you very much everyone and we'll talk soon.

1:28:37: Take care.
