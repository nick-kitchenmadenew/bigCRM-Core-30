- **description**: 2025-08-19 AI SEO Community Call Summary

ðŸ“Œ Executive Summary

This weekly AI SEO community call focused heavily on local SEO strategies, with significant discussion about SEO tool costs, the shift away from non-local SEO due to AI impact, and practical implementation questions around multi-location businesses, citations, and content strategy.

ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways

â€¢ Non-local SEO is declining: AI overviews and ChatGPT are taking significant traffic, making local SEO more viable â€¢ Tool costs can be reduced: Many expensive SEO tools provide data that doesn't change actions for local SEO â€¢ PBN links serve specific purpose: Used primarily to get content indexed, not for authority building â€¢ Multi-location strategy: Each location needs its own GBP landing page with dedicated citations and content â€¢ AI optimization differs from Google SEO: Focus on structured data, consistent business mentions, and ChatGPT optimization

ðŸ“Š Main Discussion Points

SEO Tool Cost Management

â€¢ Key points: Client questioned keeping both SEMrush and Moz subscriptions â€¢ Insights: For local SEO, domain authority metrics aren't crucial; Caleb canceled $300/month Ahrefs and team didn't notice for 4 months â€¢ Actionable tips: Evaluate what data you actually act on; consider if removing tools would impact your process

Local vs Non-Local SEO Strategy

â€¢ Key points: Strong recommendation against pursuing non-local SEO â€¢ Insights: AI overviews have dramatically reduced non-local traffic; local SEO remains viable â€¢ Actionable tips: Focus on local SEO; if doing non-local, optimize for ChatGPT rather than Google rankings

Heat Map Keyword Selection

â€¢ Key points: How to choose keywords for local rank tracking â€¢ Insights: Always track primary category + city; add high-value services the client cares about â€¢ Actionable tips: Track 3-5 keywords maximum; focus on profitable services, not low-value jobs like "leaky faucet"

Citations and Multi-Location Setup

â€¢ Key points: Proper citation strategy for businesses with multiple locations â€¢ Insights: Each GBP location needs separate citations; Lead Snap recommended for $20 one-time citation package â€¢ Actionable tips: Use Lead Snap for 51 high-quality citations; join chambers of commerce 70-80 miles away if local ones don't provide good links

AI Optimization Strategy

â€¢ Key points: How to optimize content for ChatGPT and AI overviews â€¢ Insights: PBN links don't help AI visibility; focus on structured data and consistent business name mentions â€¢ Actionable tips: Use FAQ structured data; ensure business name consistency across all mentions; optimize for Bing for Business

ðŸ’¡ Notable Q&A

Q: Should I still get into non-local SEO? A: No, AI overviews have taken massive traffic. Local SEO is still viable, but non-local is declining rapidly.

Q: How do I optimize for AI visibility? A: Focus on structured data (especially FAQ schema), consistent business mentions, and Bing for Business profile for ChatGPT recommendations.

Q: What's the best citation strategy for multiple locations? A: Each location needs separate Lead Snap citations ($20 each) plus local chamber/organization links specific to each city.

Q: Do PBN links help with AI rankings? A: No, PBN links are only for getting content indexed by Google, not for AI visibility or authority building.

Q: How many articles should I create for multi-location businesses? A: Start with core 30 per location (120 for 4 locations), but watch rank maps - you'll likely need fewer as domain gains topical authority.

ðŸ”® Emerging Trends & Challenges

â€¢ AI traffic dominance: Non-local searches increasingly answered by AI without click-throughs â€¢ Local SEO stability: Local searches still drive traffic and conversions effectively â€¢ Tool consolidation: Agencies reducing expensive tool subscriptions as data becomes less actionable â€¢ Citation quality over quantity: Shift from 200 spammy citations to 50 high-quality ones â€¢ ChatGPT optimization: New focus on optimizing for AI recommendations rather than traditional rankings

ðŸ›  Tools & Resources Mentioned

â€¢ Lead Snap: $20 citation package, rank mapping, GBP management and locking â€¢ Page Optimizer Pro: Keyword density and LSI analysis tool â€¢ QGP (Quality Guest Posts): Alternative link building service (~$25 PBN links) â€¢ Ice Cream Truck Shop: Caleb's PBN service ($30 per link) â€¢ Asana: Task management for content workflow â€¢ GMB Everywhere: Competitor category research

0:06: All right, welcome, welcome. Today, of course, is August 19th and it is 1:00

0:13: Central time. Uh, this is our weekly Zoom huddle. Uh, so, uh, as before, I

0:20: think this has worked out well the past couple of times. Uh, if you have a question, go ahead and raise your hand

0:26: or just type it into the chat. I'm gonna go ahead and keep the chat open. So, if your hand is up, then we'll take them

0:33: one at a time. Uh, I'll ask what your question is. You get one question, no

0:38: follow-ups, unfortunately. Uh, if you do have a follow-up question, go ahead and put your hand up a second time. You'll

0:45: be at the end of the line, and then when we get to you, you can go ahead and ask your follow-up. In the interim, any

0:51: questions that are asked on the chat, I'll go ahead and answer those in between hand raised questions. So,

0:56: you're going to get your question answered quicker if you put it in a chat, but if you don't want to, that's no problem. Go ahead and just put your

1:03: hands up. Um, yeah, cool. Uh, hopefully everyone's okay with that. It's gone

1:08: pretty well the last couple of times, I think. Uh, so without further ado, I do have, uh, a backend in about an hour and

1:16: a half to get the kiddos from school. Uh, so yeah, Jeff, how are you today?

1:22: Everybody, I'm doing well. So, I have uh expensive subscriptions probably like all of us to SCM Rush, um MozPro, and

1:31: all the other tools that we talk about for the most part. Um I'm looking to minimize minimize my expenses. Um things

1:38: are just getting out of hand. So, what I use Seamrush and Ma for slightly

1:46: different things. Um but I'm looking to try to get down to one. uh what is your

1:52: your opinion or the group's opinion on going down to one if you if you were

1:58: budgeting for the perfect tool and I know there's not one um what would you guys choose Caleb what what are your

2:05: suggestions so a good question for local SEO um I

2:11: don't use any of those tools anymore we used to use ahrefs and it was $200 or $300 a month something like that and I

2:19: cancelled the subscription Uh because for local SEO, we just like domain rating, domain authority, those

2:25: are metrics that just aren't very important for local SEO. So, we don't care about them. I I stopped checking

2:31: them. So, I just let the subscription lapse. And it's funny, one of the things that we offer in the ice cream truck is

2:39: keyword research. And the way that we do keyword research uses ah refs. So, my

2:45: team member, I sent him, hey, we got a keyword research order. Please take care of this. He sends me a message back and

2:50: he's like, "Hey, I tried to log into ah refs and it wasn't working." And I was like, "Oh yeah, I canled ahrefs." That

2:56: was 4 months later, the first time we had gone to use it after I canceled it.

3:02: And you know, frankly, we don't really do keyword research for local SEO either

3:09: because we know all of the third party tools are wrong, right? They can't track search volume. They the keyword

3:15: difficulty or any metrics like that are just wrong. and will give you the wrong idea. So, we don't do keyword research

3:21: for local. So, we only did it for non-local. And frankly, non-local SEO,

3:28: uh, yeah, the writing's on the wall for non-local SEO. Like, I would not be trying to optimize non-local. AI

3:34: overview is taking your traffic. Chat GPT is taking your traffic. Uh, SER features have been taking your traffic

3:40: for years. We got into local SEO because of how good chat GPT3 and a half was way

3:46: back in November of 2022. So, I don't know. My

3:52: real question back to you then, Jeff, I suppose, for you to consider how your agency works is what are you using those

3:58: tools for? What metrics are you pulling from them? And if you didn't have those metrics, if you weren't pulling those

4:04: metrics from those tools, how much would it actually affect your agency's process? because I'm not exaggerating

4:11: when I say I canceled a $300 a month tool and no one at my agency noticed for

4:17: four months. Yeah. The thing for me is I have international clients in Israel. Um so

4:22: I'm actually doing global SEO for companies. Um and that's what I'm I'm

4:27: doing. I'm using it using some of those tools for competitive research. Um that way I can compare how things are.

4:33: Competitive research for non-local. Yeah. Yeah. For global companies. Yeah.

4:39: Well, so competitive research for local, we don't use keyword research tools. We don't use domain rating. None of those

4:45: metrics mean anything for local SEO. It only makes sense for non-local. And if you are doing a lot of non-local,

4:52: then I would agree that you'd need one of those tools. Those are one of those

4:57: is important for non-local. So, did you find that did you choose a ahref over simrush for a specific

5:04: reason? ahrefs uh it h it's the all of the tools

5:10: are quite bad when it comes to their backlink database and that's the main goal of what a lot of them do uh one of

5:16: the reasons we went with ah refs and this is many years ago we made this choice semrush was it Seamrush or Moz

5:23: one of the two doesn't matter one of the two either Semrush or Moz published a study where they compared all of the

5:30: third party tools and they compared their backlink data against Google rank position

5:36: and AHREFs was the winner by far. AHRS didn't publish that result, one of

5:44: their competitors published it. If I had done that study and I was an AHR's competitor, I probably wouldn't have

5:50: published those results, but whatever they did, so we went with ah refs for that reason. We got used to it. We got

5:57: familiar with it as a keyword research tool, uh, etc., etc., etc. But yeah, um

6:03: for non-local or for local, you just don't need that stuff. Uh and for

6:08: non-local, then the, you know, question comes back. Okay, so you only want one of them. Uh how much action do you

6:16: actually take based on the information? That's one of the things that we looked at, right? We're running all these reports. We're looking at all this data.

6:23: Um and we're not giving it to clients because they don't care and it's overwhelming. And eventually we realized

6:31: I realized that internally we weren't actually taking any action based on this

6:37: data. Like no matter what the data was, we're going to do the same thing. So then at that point it was like okay well

6:42: why am I going to gather the data if it doesn't change what I'm going to do? Uh

6:47: so I mean that's probably how not probably that's how I would think about it for your agency for these tools like

6:53: what data are you gathering and then what are you actively doing based on that data. Um and I can't give you

7:01: specifics about Semrush or Moz or anything because I don't have any experience in that. We almost

7:06: exclusively used AHS for a lot of this type of thing. All right so let's see. Uh Jay asks how

7:12: do you figure out what keywords to put in the heat maps? Good question. Uh, we're always going to track for the main

7:18: keyword. It's going to be primary category, city name. Uh, primary category, city name, plumber, Houston,

7:25: whatever that may be. That's almost always the top keyword we're going to track. Um, after that one, it's going to

7:32: be whatever services or categories the client really, really cares about. So

7:38: again, with the plumber example, uh we're going to track plumber Houston,

7:43: water heater replacement Houston, main drain line replacement Houston, and that's it. And the other two, water

7:49: heater replacement and main drain line, we're going to track those because those jobs are worth $1,000 in profit to any

7:55: plumber that gets them. So they really, really want those jobs. We're not going to track clogged toilet or leaky faucet

8:01: because it doesn't really matter. They don't want those jobs. And beyond that, keep in mind, right, Google knows that

8:09: water heater replacement, main drain line, leaky faucet, etc., etc. Google knows that those are all highly

8:14: topically relevant to plumbers. So, the way Google's map algorithm currently works is if you rank for the most

8:21: competitive term, which is going to be the primary category, you will also most likely rank for all of the highly

8:28: related terms on on top of that. One of the only times we've had to adjust

8:33: things a little bit is for HVAC clients. Um the first like knee-jerk, hey, this

8:40: is the main category. The one that we care about tracking would be HVAC contractor. Um but we use GMP

8:47: everywhere. We looked at a lot of HVAC companies around. My right contact is weird. Anyway, sorry for like I'm not

8:54: winking. I'm trying to get my contact fixed. Anyway, um, so we used GMBB

9:00: everywhere. We looked at a lot of categories and services for competitors, which we do all the time. And what we

9:07: saw for HVAC contractor is very few of them actually used HVAC contractor as their primary category. Uh, when I say

9:14: very few of them, what I mean to say is very few of the ones who were ranking in cities like Houston. I love Houston as

9:21: an example city when we're doing research for local SEO. Um, Houston is

9:26: the largest city in the United States that has a population

9:32: full of people who live in single family homes, right? Obviously, New York City, LA, Chicago, those are busy, bigger

9:39: cities than Houston, but Chicago, LA, New York City, not as many single family

9:45: homes. Houston is spread out. Tons of single family homes, same types of services, same types of searches that

9:52: most people look for in smaller cities. But of course in Houston, much more competitive because it's larger.

9:58: Obviously, if you're looking for something like uh a furnace repair, Houston is a terrible example. If you're

10:03: looking for snow removal, Houston's a terrible example. So, adjust. But for the most part, Houston is the key one we

10:09: go to. And we kept seeing over and over that these HVAC contractors were using air conditioning repair as their primary

10:16: category. So with that realization, we just called the client and said, "Hey,

10:22: what type of job do you normally get the most? Like what's your favorite job to get?" And they said their favorite job

10:28: is air conditioning repair. Because most of the time they're going to get a call for air conditioning repair. They're

10:34: going to go over to the house and it's going to require a replacement. But very few people will call and say, "Hey, I

10:41: need an air conditioner replacement." They're just going to call and say, "My air conditioner is busted. I need a new one." So that's how we figured it out

10:47: with the HVAC contractor. And beyond that, it's right, it's talk to the client. What do they care about? What do

10:52: they want to rank for? What services make them money? What calls do they get a lot of? And then that's your target

10:58: keyword. Uh we don't do Yeah. this fancy keyword research or anything. All right. And Peter asks to get the narrative I I

11:07: can't even read this. Maybe I I might have to step up and put my glasses on. Okay. to get the narrative form content

11:13: generated by the GBP prompt onto a generic WordPress theme. Uh, so I'm not sure what you mean by GBP prompt. Uh,

11:19: maybe you mean a content prompt. Do you have a dev alter the theme to allow space for content, especially the longer service? I am not following at all what

11:27: you're talking about. I mean, uh, you're asking how do we get content onto WordPress? I mean, yeah, we have a

11:33: developer who just puts it on on WordPress. Um,

11:39: if you're asking how we get the GBP post content, well, we just have GBP posts that we just copy paste. They're fairly

11:46: short results and we just put them on the the Google GBP. Go ahead and ask a

11:51: follow-up question if I'm not understanding because I do not think I'm understanding that question. Can I clarify?

11:57: Uh, no. You can, if you want to, you can raise your hand. Uh, am Matthew. Uh, so

12:05: you really would recommend not getting into non-local SEO at this point? Yes, I would recommend not getting into non-local SEO. Um, uh, AI overview has

12:14: basically taken a huge amount of search volume and yeah, of traffic rather, not

12:20: search volume. AI overview has taken a huge amount of traffic. Uh, if I had a client who was in non-local SEO, I would

12:28: seriously have to think about whether that was something that would work out over the long term. You can of course

12:35: get featured in the AI overview. Uh, but there's just so little traffic that

12:40: comes with AI overview. All right, Lucas asks, "I'm meeting with clients to sell on a performance-based. Once the

12:46: contract is signed, payment is made. What's the onboarding and fulfillment? Should I follow the process outlined in

12:51: AIS mastery pro just swapping the performance terms or would you recommend adjusting that process in any way for

12:57: per so it depends on what your agreement is Lucas. Uh I do have uh we did a performance-based uh agreement that we

13:03: ran for many many months. Uh all everything that we ran including the contract including the sales script is

13:10: all in the Facebook ads training and you can see my best advice for a

13:16: performance-based contract there. um happy to chat about specific details, uh

13:21: things like that, but I mean for obvious reasons, usually my knee-jerk reaction is going to be what we did and what we

13:28: had success with. And that's all in the Facebook ads module, which you have access to. If you don't, let me know,

13:34: but you should have access to it. All right. For a multilocation business, I have four separate homepages. Correct.

13:40: For the main business category, for each of these locations or multiple secondary categories, uh are these? Yes. So the

13:47: way that a multilocation looks Jeremy is every single GBP landing page uh is

13:53: going to serve as a mini homepage and the core 30 you'll build out under each

13:58: one of those uh GBP landing pages for a local business. So for a fourlo business

14:05: your core 30 is actually core 120. Now, the giant asterisk, the giant caveat

14:10: there is if you're building out the core 120, make sure you're watching the local rank map because you will find that you

14:18: don't need topical relevance anymore long before you get 120 uh articles

14:23: about each one of those or 30 articles for each one of those four GBPs. Okay.

14:29: Columbus, Ohio is a good city. Yeah, that's true. Columbus, Ohio, it's a sizable city in the Midwest, so it's

14:35: cold sometimes. They actually have all four seasons. That's a good suggestion, Derek. I love it. Uh, and usually, and I

14:42: I I make this joke a lot, but if I'm just looking for like a generic Midwest city, like 100 200,000 people, what does

14:49: it look like? I'm usually going to go straight to Fort Wayne, Indiana. I've never been there, but it's just such a

14:55: generic sounding place. If you're from there, I'm sorry if this is insulting. It's just such a generic sounding place

15:02: that I I'm always looking, hey, how hard is it to rank in Fort Wayne, Indiana? It's probably close in all of these

15:09: other different cities. Uh Jeff says local SEO is still valuable because AI

15:14: tooling to get the summary data. Yes. Okay. So Jeff, you're hitting something uh pretty good. So when I say non-local

15:20: SEO is not valuable, what I mean is trying to rank a non-local page on

15:25: Google rankings is not super valuable. Taking a non-local SEO client and optimizing their content to be featured

15:33: in chat GPT is often massively valuable. Generally, uh, optimizing for chat GPT

15:40: is significantly more valuable than optimizing for Google's own AI overview.

15:46: Um, the click-through rate for AI overview is minuscule. Um but especially

15:54: if you provide a service like a non-local service, it's very common that people will ask chat GPT like hey uh so

16:01: I don't know just to share something personally I'm thinking about hiring a like speech uh speaking coach uh not

16:10: that I can't speak I can but I could always be better. So, I'm thinking about hiring a speaking coach because I spend

16:16: a lot of time on film and on YouTube and obviously I asked Chat GPT for who it

16:22: would recommend as a speaking coach. Uh, and of course, I couldn't help myself.

16:27: Uh, it recommended three businesses and I looked at their websites to figure out why was Chat GPT recommending these

16:34: three and they had excellent uh uh local business schema, structured data. It

16:40: wasn't local business schema, it was structured data. They had excellent structured data and when you compare the

16:45: structured data to what chat GPT said it was almost pulling word for word from

16:50: some of their websites which is something very cool that you can do uh if you have an FAQ especially and then

16:56: you use structured data for that FAQ you can get chat GPT to not only recommend

17:02: but basically word for word repeat what you have on there. Uh but yes I

17:07: completely agree optimizing for chat GPT very valuable. Uh, thank you for the clarification. Uh, Lucas, awesome. Okay,

17:15: good. Glad that you've seen that. Uh, Bruce, you mentioned in your last YouTube video that as AICO grows,

17:20: backlinks become less and less meaningful. True, I did mention that. I know links like chamber are still important, but can you talk about the

17:26: role of regular backlinks from the ice cream truck? Okay, good question, Bruce. So, um, there are two types of links

17:33: that we do in local SEO. The first type of link uh is the PBN link, the blog

17:40: comments, uh stuff like that. And that type of link is a low to medium quality

17:46: link that we're going to point to URLs with the express and only purpose of

17:51: convincing Google's algorithm that that content is not AI generated slop. Okay,

17:57: that makes it much more likely for Google to index, much more likely for Google to read it, much more likely for Google to care about it. that type of

18:04: this isn't slop uh link meaningless to chat GPT meaningless to Google's AI

18:10: overview it's only done for Google's base rank algorithm so over the next few

18:16: years if we would expect potentially who knows what their plan is but if we would

18:21: expect that Google will update its base algorithm to incorporate more and more of what the AIs are looking for then

18:28: that type of link will become unnecessary um because that's because the AI I uh from everything I've seen,

18:35: from everything I've experienced, from everything we've looked at, the AIS don't crawl the internet in the same way

18:40: that Googlebot does. So the AIS don't follow links, which is why that type of link is kind of meaningless. So you

18:46: mentioned something like chamber. So, if you're trying to get authority with chat GPT and you join the local chamber of

18:53: commerce, one thing that I will often say is that chamber link, uh, it's often

18:58: a good idea to check the chambers directory to see if they're giving do

19:03: follow simple text links. Some chambers don't do that. Right now, if you're optimizing for chat GPT, you don't care

19:10: at all. You don't care if they don't give you a link at all. All you care about if you're optimizing for AI is

19:15: that they mention your business name. character for character to match the same business name because that's how

19:21: chat GPT that's how the AI overview sees it, right? But you don't care about the links anymore. And there's an example of

19:28: this uh I I think I went through it in one of my YouTube videos where there was like I can't remember the exact name of

19:33: the company, but it was like ABC Plumbing or something like that. And ABC Plumbing was ranking really well on

19:40: Google Maps, but ChatGpt and the Google AI overview didn't rank them at all. And

19:45: um I have a prompt to get chat GPT or Claude to do the uh a citations audit.

19:52: And when you run that citations audit on ABC Plumbing, what we see is a bunch of

19:58: their mentions, a bunch of their citations had a b.c.plumbing, a bunch of them had ABC plumbing and

20:04: heating and stuff like that, right? And chat GPT people call it artificial intelligence. It's not. It's pretty

20:11: stupid, right? So, it doesn't know that ABC Plumbing and A.B.C.P. plumbing is

20:17: the same business. So, it wasn't recommending them because it didn't connect the dots that those are the same business, the same mentions. Uh, so

20:23: hopefully that helps. That's the that's the real difference. Yeah. Uh, articles or pages on the core 30. Uh, it doesn't

20:31: really matter. I say article, I say page. I don't care about the structure of whatever plat website platform that

20:37: you're building. I don't care if they're blog posts. I don't care if they're pages. It truly doesn't matter. What

20:42: matters is that the content is there, that Googlebot can read and understand the topical relevance. Uh, my brother's

20:50: in-laws live in Fort Wayne. Hey, I hope Fort Wayne is nice. I've never been there. Um, boy, a lot of chat questions.

20:56: We're going to get there. All right. I've gone through most of the material in the Facebook ad course. Ah, Lucas. Okay. Performance-based. Excellent. Uh,

21:03: the course material seems to focus on the steps leading up to signing the contract. Trying to better understand what happens after signing.

21:10: So maybe I'm So the way that that contract is structured, right, it's a it's an upfront geographical location

21:16: fee and then it's pay per lead after. And the way we monitored that pay per lead, we used high level for that. If

21:22: you want the snapshot, we used uh send me a message on school and I can give you that snapshot. Um, so we used a high

21:29: level for that with a snapshot and that meant every call, every text, every form fill was going to appear in the um was

21:38: going to appear in the conversations tab. All of the calls were automatically recorded. And I had a VA every week who

21:45: would listen to every call to every client and decide is that call a lead, is that call marketing spam, uh, or is

21:54: was that a missed call? And we would text every client on Fridays over the

22:00: last seven days from the last Friday to Thursday. Here's how many missed calls you had. Here's how many leads you had.

22:06: Here's how many marketing spam calls you had. And we texted them that every Friday. And then I had a bunch of

22:12: pre-written messages to go along with it. If the lead call percentage was too high, if the spam call percentage was

22:19: quite high, uh if the number of leads was lower or higher, I had all of these

22:24: messages pre-written that they could copy paste in along with that text message giving them the update. Uh and

22:31: that way hopefully at the end of the month, they weren't surprised by their invoice because we've let them know

22:36: every single week how many leads they got that past week. And the real big thing there is that we help them monitor

22:43: their missed call rate. Missed call rate I am espe for doing this for uh years

22:49: and you know like over a 100 local SEO clients missed call rate really really

22:55: really looks like it's a rank factor. If you stop answering your phone your rank

23:00: usually tanks within a couple of weeks. Uh, which makes sense cuz Google cares about goal completion. And if you don't

23:07: answer your phone, that's a bad goal completion. That's a bad customer experience. And for anyone, I've said

23:13: this before and people will say like, "Oh, well, Google doesn't know if you're answering the phone." Holy [ __ ] yes, they do. You think they created Android

23:19: out of the goodness of their heart, Android is on half of the phones in the United States. Google knows exactly if

23:24: you're answering the phone or not because it sees all of the data from its smartphone operating system that is free

23:31: for anyone who wants it. Uh so anyway, uh so that was one of the key things that we wanted to do to monitor that

23:38: weekly because we saw uh if a client went a week or two and had a high missed

23:43: call rate, the ranking would tank. So every week we hit them over the head. High missed call rate, low missed call

23:49: rate. Now it's less of a concern. Uh, High Level of course has the AI voice agent built in. So, your missed call

23:55: rate should effectively be zero. Okay. Jay says, "All my local chambers are no follow. No problem. Uh, maybe go a

24:02: little bit wider out, find additional ones. Uh, we have clients and we've joined chambers of commerce that are 70

24:07: 80 miles away and it's been helpful. Local is uh relative, right? All right.

24:13: Uh, Jeremy, I Oh, okay. And you know what? I give me like two minutes. I'm

24:20: going to go get my glasses. cuz I just can't even see the screen. Hold on. Sorry.

25:02: All right. Sorry about that. All right, Jeremy. Ah, now I can see

25:08: Jeremy. Glad that you understand. Perfect. Uh, interlinking service page.

25:14: Right. I I mean, uh, maybe I'm not still following your question, right? uh all of the service pages, all of the

25:19: category pages would be interlin uh to the GBP uh that's underneath it because

25:24: your service pages are going to be service target city. And obviously for the different locations, you'll have

25:30: different target cities. So they'll each live in under their own hierarchy and you won't interlink the different

25:35: cities. So they are under hierarchy. You're saying they're they're subservient pages. They're not it's not a flat

25:41: structure. They're in folders inside each Well, each well, I don't care about folders because I don't care about URL

25:47: structure. The internal linking is what sets the structure, but each one lives underneath its uh GBP landing page.

25:55: Uh let's see. Uh Billy wants the link for the citations. No problem. I will

26:00: drop it. And if you don't have access to the modern SEO group, um

26:07: go ahead and let me know and we'll get you access.

26:15: uh without having to pay for it. It's obviously normally not free, but you guys are in the pro group and that comes

26:21: with I wish school had a way to do it automatically, but as far as I can tell, they don't. Um, so yeah, if you don't

26:29: have access to that, send me a message on school and we'll get you access and we won't charge you. All right. Uh, I

26:35: just got a new location suspended. Not sure why does the name and email have to be different on each location on the

26:41: GBP? the name doesn't. Uh, I would probably use a different email address for each location. Uh, that being said,

26:48: if you just recorded a GBP verification video and the location got like immediately suspended, that's super

26:55: common. Happens all the time. I would say that uh probably that's happened to

27:00: us 30 to 40% of the time. We record uh we get a GBP verified and a day or two

27:06: later it the G the new GBP gets suspended. Uh, so you know, you just appeal the suspension, you get two

27:12: appeals. Uh, so give them all the paperwork, all the documentation. Make sure everything matches the GBP name,

27:19: address, phone number, character for character. Uh, if they don't match, as long as it's non-public information, uh,

27:26: you can just make sure they match. Uh, if they're public information, you can't cuz Google's uh, employees will look up

27:32: public information. So like if you need a license like a plumber for example um

27:38: then it's much more difficult. The plumber will need to make sure their license incorporates the second or third location. All right Lucas perfect. How

27:46: would you implement for some calls coming in? Um okay so if a if a client

27:51: already has some calls coming in then yeah one way is the new number on the GBP and forward to the business number.

27:57: That's basically the way we did it all the time. Right. Every new client uh we built them a new website. Most of the

28:02: clients we had to get them a new GBP and that came with a new uh phone number. Uh

28:08: all right, Jeff. Oh, yes. Oh, Jeff dealed with Jeff dealt forever with that suspension, but it's over now. All

28:14: right. That was a lot of questions. Jay, what's going on, man? And you already asked a

28:21: couple of questions in the chat. No problem. No problem. I try to get away with murder. Uh just

28:26: real quick the you mentioned last week about optimizing

28:33: for AI. So I started doing that because I'm building the pages on my site. Now I'm

28:39: doing it both for map pack and AI. Is there a better way to do this than just

28:46: you know through like cloud or chat? A better way to do what? to optimize it

28:52: for AI, you know, so that you're going to get p we've already been picked up on chat GPT. Um, but I wanted to get all

29:00: the pages that are, you know, going to be more likely to be picked up on chat GPT later,

29:07: right? So, every page doesn't need to be picked up, especially if it's for local.

29:12: Then you really just need chat GPT to trust that local business that it can provide that core service. Uh longtail

29:19: keywords are much more common with chat GPT. Uh people will often ask chat GPT.

29:24: Like for example, something like, "Oh, I have a lead main drain line. Who would

29:30: you recommend to replace the lead main drain line?" Uh that's not something that you'll usually get uh on Google. Uh

29:36: but you'll get that on chat GPT. So, um, one of the one of the things that we

29:43: know that chat GPT does, uh, is it will actually read reviews. And if you have

29:49: reviews that talk about, yeah, this plumber replaced my lead main drain line, then chat GPT will mention that

29:55: and bring it up. If you don't have reviews that say that, no problem. Uh, hopefully your competitors also don't,

30:00: and you know, probably they don't because that's pretty longtail ask. uh then what we will often rely on cuz

30:07: obviously main like lead main drain lines I know that's a kind of a silly example uh but it comes up quite a bit

30:13: but questions like that come up quite a bit uh and the best place to look for

30:18: them is on Reddit uh so let me give you another prompt this is in the modern SEO

30:24: group and basically what this prompt does is it gets uh either chatgpt or claude to go onto local forms being a

30:32: core example but there's other ones next door, etc., etc. The AI goes onto these local forms and looks for what are

30:40: people actually looking for, asking about for this local business in this location. And then you can build that

30:47: language, those questions into your FAQ. Uh, and it's a really, really good way to get the AI with structured data to

30:55: basically repeat exactly what you want them to. So, if you ran this prompt and you're in, I don't know, uh, Fort Wayne,

31:02: we'll just use Fort Wayne for fun. Uh, let's pretend that Fort Wayne has a ton of lead main drain lines. I don't know

31:08: if Fort Wayne is an old enough city to have that or not. Uh, but if it does have a ton of lead main drain lines,

31:14: then this prompt would find that there are people on Reddit talking about lead main drain lines in Fort Wayne and then

31:20: you would be able to incorporate that into your FAQ so that Chat GPT would be

31:26: more likely to recommend you for that very very specific service. Um so that

31:31: uh beyond that like it's really just you know this the material that we have in that pro uh it's I think it's the last

31:40: one uh it's the third to last one just optimizing for chat GPT uh in the AI SEO

31:45: mastery pro um there's not as much there you most of the time uh the businesses

31:53: that rank well on Google do pretty well on chat GPT also there's only a couple of times where that's different The

31:59: biggest example of businesses that don't rank well on chat GPT when they're ranking well on Google are businesses

32:05: that have ignored their Bing for business, right? Because remember chatgpt uses Bing, not Google. Uh so you

32:12: need to have a Bing for business. Uh if you want ChatGpt to recommend you as a local business, obviously I'm slightly

32:18: biased because I have an affiliate link, but it's the same exact tool we use at my agency. Lead Snap will create your

32:24: Bing for business with an API connection. and you don't have to deal with the postcard [ __ ] It'll also

32:29: do it for 50 other ones. Uh I have seen a lot of uh businesses uh get

32:35: recommended by Chat GPT just a couple of weeks after doing the lead snap citations. Um all right, cool. Kyle, how

32:42: you doing, man? Good to see you. You're muted.

32:49: Still muted. There you go. Sorry, my my computer's got a little lag to it. Sorry about that. All right. So,

32:55: I got a quick question about uh GBP address. So, I'm going to share my screen real quick if that's okay.

33:01: Should be Let's allow it. Yep. Okay.

33:11: All right. Can you see it? I can. All right. Cool. So, if I

33:18: show you what I've got here so far. So, if you look at the address, you'll see this vacation village and there's no

33:23: drive here. So, my client had it like this and he's like, I need the drive. And I was like, that's fine. So, I go to

33:28: edit profile, right? Go down to the address section and I actually edit it the other day and it says drive here.

33:36: Uh, but I've waited like a day or two and still on this view and I just like

33:41: pulled it up randomly on maps. It's still not showing drives. So, I don't

33:46: know if there's like a lag or there's also this like weird little note here that says, you know, Google has updated

33:54: your address. So, I'm just concerned about consistency in citations. Like, is

33:59: the drive actually there? Is it not? Because the UI is showing me a couple different things. I don't know if we've run into this before.

34:06: Uh, I haven't. And my guess is your business location was updated by Google means that yeah, as it says, Google

34:12: probably maybe removed the drive because it's consistent with what it's seeing elsewhere online. Um,

34:17: okay. So, so I I I hate this to feel

34:23: like another plug for Lead Snap, but um we use Lead Snap for a lot of these

34:29: changes now because uh its connection directly with a GBP will often prevent

34:36: Google from dealing with this like type of thing. Uh, and Lead Snap also allows

34:42: you to lock GVPs so that users and Google can't suggest updates anymore.

34:49: Uh, really common one, of course, the pin moving, but that doesn't work anymore, thankfully. Uh, so now we had

34:56: some clients and, um, their competitors were helpfully suggesting that they were

35:01: permanently closed. Uh, which, you know, thank you, but we're not. Uh so stuff like that, you know, we can uh prevent

35:08: that from happening, from changing by locking it. Um, and a lot of these changes are just easier to push through

35:15: if you're making the if you make the change on a lead snap or a tool like it,

35:21: a GBP management tool like it rather than making the change on the Google business profile field itself because

35:28: it's so many times like we'll do something like we'll change a primary category and we'll go back and look in a

35:33: few days and Google has decided to change it back. Right. So quick quick curveball for you on lead

35:39: snap. So, um, I did try to do that, right? I've been using Lead Snap's API to make all my changes on my GBP and

35:45: Lead Snap does not currently support changing address. Uh, I texted with their support the other day and they're

35:50: like, "Nope, we're working on it, but we don't do that yet." So, I was like, "So, my recourse is to go into GBP directly."

35:55: And they're like, "Yep." So, hear you. Uh, do that for everything else. But right now, that's not a functionality.

36:01: So, um, I guess we'll wait. Uh, but yeah, man. I don't know if there's like another tool you'd recommend with the

36:07: APIs if it keeps doing this to me. uh since lead snap's you know still working on it. Yeah. If if if they don't then uh I

36:15: don't have another tool that would work. Basically what we would do what we used to do uh is we would just create

36:21: calendar reminders and just go check every couple of days and just keep making the update. Eventually Google

36:28: will stop changing it back. What I may do is I I may use the

36:33: citations tool within because you know the GBP editor and the citations are two different sections within links. I may

36:39: uh forceedit the drive on the citations detail section, push that to all the others and then maybe Google will stop

36:45: seeing the address and changing it. Um so that I'll try that too. Yeah, especially if the I mean or you

36:52: could do the other way and hey if Google hates the drive then uh force a citation update without the word drive.

37:01: All right, man. Well, thanks for troubleshooting with me. I'll continue to explore and I'll let you know if I have any insights for you.

37:07: Sure. Let me know. Let's see. Uh mine did the same thing. Jeff, anyone using virtual office to build GBP? Yeah. Uh so

37:15: Billy responded um uh against using it. I would usually give the same advice. Uh

37:22: you it used to be that you could more easily get a virtual office approved as a GBP location. Uh but it's just getting

37:29: harder and harder. Honestly, uh not that I would ever suggest this, but um what

37:35: we have had some success with in terms of getting other GVP locations, the best thing to do for the long-term health of

37:42: the business, right? Because if you're getting a second location, then my assumption is you're ranking the first

37:48: location pretty well. And if the first location is ranking, then they're getting calls, uh they're getting

37:53: business, they're doing well, etc., etc., etc. So when we're start talking about adding a location, it's usually a

38:00: second, third, fourth location, something like that. And when we add

38:05: those locations, the best long-term solution is to just get cheap office

38:11: space, right? Uh office space is like at all-time vacancy lows or vacancy highs,

38:18: I guess. Um so office space you can get very inexpensively. We had a client,

38:23: this is a few months ago now, but we had a client and we rented them an office like in downtown Denver for like 400

38:32: $400 or $500 a month. Like something really inexpensive. Uh we got the signs, we got the business cards, all that jazz

38:39: to for film the video and get a GBP on that office. And you know, a few hundred bucks a month. Um definitely worth it

38:46: for a GBP location. Uh assuming of course you follow the process and get it ranked. The other option,

38:53: uh, I've talked about this before, is something like an Airbnb. Uh, when you rent an Airbnb, they'll give you the

39:00: address of that Airbnb. So, you could always rent it for a week or two, uh,

39:06: rent it a couple of day, a month or two out. That gives you time to do the press release, uh, to do the crappy citations,

39:14: both of which help with GBP verification. Those citations do nothing else except help with GBP verification.

39:20: So, don't buy those unless you're trying to verify a new GBP. Uh, but anyway, um,

39:25: that'll gives you that 30 days to let the press release and the crappy citations and that'll make it easier to

39:30: get the GBP verified. So, and then of course you only have to rent an Airbnb. So, you might say, why don't I suggest

39:36: that all the time? Well, we see this over and over again when a new business pushes its way into the top three. Uh,

39:43: you've done that by pushing another business out, right? SEO is zero sum. There's only three winners in any given

39:49: city. And when a business is pushed out of the top three, they typically notice.

39:55: And a very common response to getting pushed out of the top three is they start reporting Google business profiles

40:02: in the top three as spammy, etc., etc. And if you no longer have access to that

40:08: address, it's going to be very difficult to get that GBP suspension lifted or

40:14: reverified, something like that. So, uh, the cheap office space, um, I think is

40:20: the approach that is the longest term, most reliable, most robust. Um, and

40:29: that's usually the one that that we would go through. Uh, Victor, you can just put it right in the chat.

40:34: Co-working addresses don't work. I mean, they can, right? But it's sort of you'd

40:41: have this co-working is very similar to virtual office. The point that you have

40:46: to keep in mind, right, is that Google doesn't do postcards anymore. Uh, every time you need to verify, and there are a

40:52: couple of methods on the GBP verifications where you don't need a video verification. So, you can try that

40:58: and hopefully that'll work. That would be awesome if it did. Uh, but beyond those methods that don't require a

41:03: video, you're going to need to do a video. And co-working space, virtual offices, that's just going to be really

41:09: hard to record a video uh that follows Google's rules to get verified. If you

41:15: can do it, you know, great. Uh, but it's just very hard to record a video that

41:21: meets Google's requirements in a co-working or a virtual office space. Google's officials policy says a

41:28: co-working address is okay to get a GBP verified at. The other challenge with

41:33: it, the other challenge with it, just cuz there's not quite enough um back in

41:39: the day, like a couple years ago when you didn't need to uh record the video,

41:46: when Google just mailed uh postcards, so many people used co-working spaces and

41:53: virtual offices to get their GBPs. There is a limit on how many GBPs Google will

41:58: allow at the same address. I don't think anybody knows what that number is, but

42:03: if there's a co-working space that's been around for 5 10 years, uh, if you open up Google Maps, there's probably

42:10: dozens of GBPs at that address already. All right, Davidid, how are you?

42:17: Hello, Caleb. I'm good. And you? Doing quite well, thank you. What's going on today? Uh I would like uh I

42:24: have a few question but for to start uh I would like to share my screen with you and just to make sure that I do the

42:31: competitor analysis correct. Let's do it. Okay. Thank you. Everything is already open. It will be quick but and it's in

42:38: Houston. So that sounds weird because they don't have so many page and as you mentioned that Houston always is uh very

42:46: competitive. I just wanted to um

42:53: Can you see my screen? I can. And we are looking for optometrist Houston. All right.

43:01: I don't know how to move this. Okay. Yeah. So, that's the first three. Okay. We don't count this one because he is

43:07: paying. That's an ad, correct? Yep. Yep. Yep. Okay. As a quick side note, who's ever running that ad is an idiot, right?

43:14: Because not only does it say sponsored, so everyone knows it's an ad. Look at those four. 39 reviews, 1,200 reviews,

43:22: 1100 reviews, 1100 reviews. Who's ever paying for that ad is just wasting money. No one is going to call the

43:28: business with 39 reviews. Uh or the business is with a thousand. Okay? So,

43:34: please, if you're running local ads for clients, please don't do what whoever the hell is doing this for Heights

43:39: Vision is. They're just wasting money. I'm sorry. Go ahead, Davidid. Yeah. I know I'm not running this ad,

43:44: but but sponsor I I should have asked before I shout all over whoever was running it. I'm glad you're not.

43:52: But sponsor is always right sponsor. So um anyway, the So this three one I opened the website. So I did that, you

43:58: know, the site site search and I open here. So I see 38 results. That's what

44:04: you teach, right? That's correct. Yeah. 38. And this this this this one 41. And then

44:11: this one which is the third third one 48 right and then I don't know I think only

44:17: one is in the SER um I have

44:23: I think this one is in the SER the other one they are not in the first page so that mean that that should be easy and

44:31: if I do like 60 page I should rank and and I follow all the things I mean local

44:36: chamber local link and uh and PBN link on all page Um, yeah. So that's is Is it correct?

44:45: Usually it weird. Yeah, it's weird. That's what And you always say Houston, Houston. So, and

44:52: unfortunately for me, I have this client in Houston. So, uh, I'm doing it myself over here and I'm

44:58: seeing the exact same thing. That's why I just wanted to be sure. The third one I'm seeing 130 pages. But

45:04: yeah, I mean like if if I looked at that and had an optometrist Houston, I'd be

45:10: like, "Yeah, 60 70 pages." I mean, that should rank. Um, and if I look at the

45:16: map, yeah, the top the three top locations

45:22: are not super close. So, they're not clustered one area. They're pretty far apart in Houston. Um, so yeah. Uh, I

45:28: might also take a look at the cuz that is weird, right? Uh, if if this were

45:34: Fort Wayne, sorry, Derek, if this were Fort Wayne, I would be like, "Yep, cool. I'm done. That looks good." Um, but

45:41: because it's Houston and that just doesn't feel right. Uh, what I would probably do, come on, if I could type.

45:49: I'm trying to unlock my password manager. 100 page and I only see 40 on each uh businesses because it's another

45:56: I might have a different I have heights eye studio as number three which is different than what you had.

46:05: Ah good. Finally got it. Uh what I will do on another screen um while I I uh

46:14: take the next question I'm going to go ahead and run I center of Houston. I'm

46:19: going to run a quick rank map on I center of Houston. Uh because I just

46:24: want to see I just want to see I mean it's just weird that the sites that small are

46:32: ranking well in Houston. Um what was it called? I center of Houston.

46:45: There it is. And the address 10101 besonet. 10101 besonet. Yes, that's

46:52: correct. So that's the one. And keyword I want optometrist

46:59: Houston. Enter. And close. Run scan. All right. I will let

47:07: you know when that's done and we'll take a look at it. Um, okay. Okay. Let's see. Victor, thoughts on acquiring

47:13: guest posts? Um, you can use guest posts, uh, but they're expensive. Uh, we

47:19: usually don't do it, um, because it's a little bit more expensive and they're not as strong as the local links like

47:28: the Chamber of Commerce or charity support organizations. Uh, but they're

47:33: too strong, like they're overkill to just get stuff indexed. Uh, so I know

47:38: you instruct us, so I don't instruct you to use PBN links. I say that we use PBN

47:44: links and you can do whatever you want. Um, so the way that we do it is on every

47:50: article we publish, we use a PBN link to point to that article. Just the hey,

47:55: this isn't AI slop type link. That's it. Uh, those build no trust at all. To

48:01: build trust, it's the Chamber of Commerce, the charity organizations, stuff like that. The to actually build

48:07: that trust and authority. Uh, the PBN links are really just, "Hey, this is an AI slot. Please index this type stuff."

48:14: Um, yeah. Cool. All right, Nadem, what's going on, man? How's it going, Caleb? You okay?

48:21: Doing real well. Doing real well. My My son is sadly his uh broken toe from

48:27: jiu-jitsu. Um, it it's still healing, so he's going to miss the uh he's going to miss the tournament, but that's okay.

48:34: Yeah, to be honest, with with jiu-jitsu, you always break your toes. It's like one of the main things you always break.

48:40: I mean, I probably have about six or six a year. You break your toes six times a year.

48:46: Yeah. It's really bad. You get used to it now. If you if you um say for instance, if you don't um the amount of

48:53: time you have off for injuries, if you if you still if you had that time off, you basically wouldn't train. So, you

48:58: just got to kind of obviously they're kids, but when you're adults, you just got to train through them. It's the only way.

49:04: That's brutal, man. All right. What you got? So basically a good voice obviously you

49:10: you told me obviously to go through your course on the the non-local SEO. Um I've

49:16: had a recommendation from someone who's this company's reached out to me. They've got a 280 page website. It's

49:24: been the website's about 25 years old. Website looks actually really good for 25 years old. So they might have had it

49:30: revamped. Um, basically their competition. They're pretty much

49:35: beating them on backlinks, everything, but they're not ranking. So, I don't think they've done any there's no SEO

49:41: properly being done. Apparently, the bloke who owned the business who's died, he did a lot of it himself. So, from

49:48: what I can see, there's a lot of like thing content stuff like that. Obviously, I only know how to do local SEO regards to the backlinking because

49:55: obviously local SEO obviously we create the pages support and content put a PBN to it and obviously get the links on the

50:01: homepage for the chamber of commerce and sponsors and stuff. With a with a non-local SEO, what do you do? So, say

50:08: for instance, every page you create, do you still put PPs on them or do you have to get like an authorative backlink?

50:16: Yeah. So, it's usually the same things that we're going to do, right? So every page we create, we're still going to do

50:21: a PBN. Uh but on top of that, we're going to have to get other trusted

50:27: authority links. Uh so that's where we might use like a niche, uh guest posts.

50:33: Uh I am a member of several websites that send out like sponsored posts type

50:40: things on a regular basis where you can have a sponsored post on a fairly high domain authority type website. Uh so

50:47: yeah, it's going to be like same type of like PBN to everything and then we'll also need these actual trust authority

50:55: building links which for non-local are less powerful and more expensive than

51:02: the local organizations things like that. Yeah. And do they go to what pages you put

51:09: them on or do you mainly put them straight to your homepage them links? We'll do a combination. Uh but usually

51:16: it's going to be the homepage. Uh and if it's not the homepage, then it's going to be like the money type page that we

51:23: want to that we're trying to rank. Uh it we usually will not do it to

51:29: supporting content or things like that. And how do I like because obviously I've

51:34: never really bought these sort of links for for um a non-local.

51:40: Obviously I got to get get together a price plan for her. So, I'm going through everything on what to do. And what I'm going to do is I'm just going

51:46: to give her three options of prices to see what suits her because I don't really know what her budget is. Um, and

51:52: the reason I'm going to do that is just I'm going to be like, "Okay, well, I'll create this many URLs. Um, you'll get

51:58: this many back links for this much a month and then different price plans for so many URLs." And that's how I'm going

52:03: to do it. Um, how do I price for that? Because I only really used to know how to price for local.

52:10: Yeah. So, it's going to be the same methodology, right? What does it cost you to produce content? What does it cost your developer to post content?

52:16: What does it cost you to go back to the already existing content and add new links to it? And what are you paying for

52:22: these links? Then add whatever margin you want on top of it. So, you need to have an idea of what links you're going

52:28: to source. Uh otherwise, yeah, you won't be able to price it. Um, but I did just

52:34: send you uh in school I just sent you um

52:39: a source that I've used before for like quality guest posts. You know, maybe I'll just I can just put it here in the

52:44: chat. Um it's not an affiliate or anything. It's just somebody that I've used before and then I'll just pull up

52:51: uh a recent email that he sends out where he has prices and domains. Um I'm

52:57: not saying use this guy. He's amazing. He's going to get you ranked. I'm saying I've used him before. Uh he does what he

53:04: says he's going to do and it's uh worked out. These are obviously much more

53:09: expensive than PBN's, but that's one of the challenges with non-local SEO. Not

53:14: only is traffic falling, but it's still hard to rank non-local. Yeah. How many of these should I be buying

53:21: then? Say for instance, per month for their website.

53:26: Depends on the scope uh what you're doing. Usually, we'll do 10 to 20% of the number of total articles, right? So,

53:33: if you're doing 10 articles a month, then we'll do one or two. Okay. Okay. Brilliant. Because I said to her, look, it's it's it ranges between

53:40: 100 to 300 pound a backlink. So, that she's already aware of that anyway. Um, so I probably went a little bit too

53:46: high. So, um, okay, brilliant. Perfect. Thank you. Awesome. Let's see. Jay asks, will PBN

53:52: links help in AI visibility? No, they will not. Not even a little bit. They will not help in AI visibility even a

53:59: little bit. If your goal is AI visibility, that type of link is going to be a waste of money. Uh, Matthew, can

54:05: I create my own site and point pages to the site I want to do SEO for instead of using PBN links? That is exactly what a

54:11: PBN is. A PBN, it stands for private blog network. And it basically means a

54:16: whole bunch of sites that you own that you're linking to clients of yours. Um,

54:23: if you want to do it yourself, feel free. Uh, but caution, it is not as easy

54:30: as it seems. Uh, if Google knows that those links are owned by you, meaning if

54:37: there is a uh if there is a

54:42: footprint where Google can tell that all of those links are from the same site uh

54:48: from the same owner, uh they won't work. Google will de-index them. So, you can build your own. Um, but you have to do

54:55: it in such a way to that Google doesn't know that they're all owned by the same person. And you'll typically need to

55:02: source links to your PBN sites because if they don't have links, they don't have any power, right? And that's I

55:08: think what Jeff was saying also here where if you just register a new domain with no links to it, that link isn't

55:14: worth anything because it's from a new domain with no links. So you're going to need to build a website in such a way

55:19: that you don't have a footprint then link build to that website and then that website you can link to yours. Um so

55:27: that's you know uh building a PBN takes a long time and it's very expensive.

55:33: Most of the PBN that uh we have at our agency uh we built manually website by

55:40: website way back in the day when we had clients like skillshare.com

55:45: paying multi5 figures uh for non-local SEO and we could afford the significant

55:51: costs to build out uh our own PBN. Um but yeah, okay. I have a client the

55:58: domain doesn't match their brand name. Nah, that's not a problem. Let's see. Does Elliot agree with me? Yeah, Google.

56:05: Yeah, Elliot agrees. Uh that's not uncommon that the brand name uh or that the domain doesn't match the brand. Not

56:10: a big deal. Uh yeah, and Jeremy mentioned uh exact match business names. Uh super common where you'll use an

56:16: exact match domain. Uh EMD for short. Um

56:22: EMDs can help. Uh but uh the caveat that I would give on that, Jeremy, I don't

56:28: know if you're still here or not. Uh, I would agree that an exact match domain will often rank faster than branded

56:34: domains, but branded domains I find, uh, will usually rank better over the long

56:40: term and a branded domain will usually do better with AI than an exact match domain. So, agreed that exact match

56:47: domains do better now, but I would expect that is not going to be the case

56:53: forever. Uh it does seem as though u branded search is becoming more and more

56:58: of a rank factor on Google. So um improving your branded search, your

57:03: branded presence, your brand mentions, things like that are uh helping you rank

57:09: on Google. And frankly, that's the only thing uh AI cares about even a little bit. Um all right. Uh what would you do

57:18: if a client keeps getting their GBP suspended? Um, I guess I would have them

57:23: stop doing whatever they're doing that gets it suspended. Like, stop having them change things on their GBP. I mean,

57:30: I uh I that's a tough question to answer because the broad answer is stop getting your [ __ ] GBP suspended, dude. I

57:37: mean, what do you want to do here? Um, but yeah, like you know, lock the GBP with lead snap or similar tool. Uh that

57:45: way the client can't change things on their own anymore. And hopefully uh you know make sure that

57:51: the GBP posts are okay. Google doesn't like your GBP posts to have links, phone numbers, advertisements. So don't put

57:58: those types of things in your GBP posts. Um yeah, like I like just whatever

58:03: they're doing that's getting it suspended, have them stop. I I think they would also be happy to not having

58:08: it suspended. Alexander, how are you today? What's going on, man?

58:16: Hey, how are you? Hey, good. Been a minute, man. Good to see you. Yeah, it is. And seeing Elliot on the

58:23: call and hearing you guys talk about Skillshare. It feels like we're back in the old days for a moment there. 2019 wants its live stream back. Jesus.

58:31: It's awesome. Well, uh, I'll keep the Upwork questions to a minimum then if that's not to bring it back too far, but

58:37: No, no worries. I still remember I don't know if you remember this, Alex. I remember being on a video call with you

58:43: and uh you had to stop me in the middle of a call because I had a giant beetle crawling from below my hair onto my

58:50: forehead. It was horrible. And then I looked at the camera and I was like, "Oh my god, that's just Anyway, go ahead." So

58:55: I I do remember that's that's a good one. But uh so you know, a long time ago

59:01: um I started using Fat Joe for you know, some of those DA20 plus blog outreach

59:06: links. And to be honest, I was doing no split testing with this whatsoever. My clients were getting good results, but

59:12: we were also doing digital PR and citation building and all this other stuff. And you know, I I was always

59:18: concerned with the quality of these Fat Joe links sometimes and whether they work or not, just kind of the way they

59:24: look. So, I started working with um with another provider that's slightly more expensive. The links look a little bit

59:31: better, but you know, mainly I'm doing this to show a scope of work, not just for the results. It seems like the wrong

59:37: thing to do, but I do like to show a a full scope of work outside of just our digital PR citation building and

59:43: content. And you know, I'm wondering just as a general question, would you

59:49: pay a little bit more for a slightly better link like that or would you stick with something that's tried and true

59:55: that's just meant to get it indexed and, you know, give a little authority? Is there any opinion there?

1:00:01: No, good question. So, one of the reasons that we almost exclusively use PBN links for local SEO, uh, we don't

1:00:08: share the links with local SEO clients, right? I'll tell them that we we're sourcing a link, blah blah blah, but

1:00:15: I'll also tell them upfront they're never going to see the link. They're not going to see the domain. Uh, if they

1:00:20: have AHFs or whatever and they run the backlink report, it's never going to appear because we have AHF blocked from

1:00:26: crawling our PBNs. Um, and yeah, like on the ice cream truck shop, if you order a

1:00:32: PBN link, you're going to get a screenshot of anchor text and nothing else. Uh, and again, that's to protect

1:00:38: the the the blog network. It's to protect the network so that you you don't know where the domain is coming from, etc., etc. If it's working, then

1:00:45: we usually just stick with it. Um, Fat Joe, I agree, it is pretty expensive. It

1:00:51: feels like their quality has dropped. Uh, we used to use them, we don't very much anymore. They basically look like

1:00:57: they're peddling PBN links, but for like $200 a piece. Uh, so let me show you

1:01:03: another link source. I've mentioned this on chats before. Uh, QGP. Uh, I don't

1:01:09: remember what it's stands for, quality, whatever. Um, I've used some of their

1:01:15: links before. I haven't used their PBNs, so I can't vouch for that, but I've used other links of theirs, and they actually

1:01:21: look pretty good, and they're reasonably well priced. Uh they look better than

1:01:26: Fat Joe, look better than Hoff, and they're much better priced than those two providers. Uh so we like them. If we

1:01:34: have a client who just really needs to see the links, then obviously we have to raise the price to account for that. And

1:01:40: then we'll usually use something from QGP. All right, great. I'll check QGP out. I

1:01:45: appreciate that. I had one more question. You know, I've known Patrick Shannon for so long that this feels like

1:01:51: a betrayal to to ask about lead snap here, but uh you know, I've been on Bright Local for so long and it's, you

1:01:57: know, it's pretty expensive for what it is. I I like the heat maps on it. I like the heat map history and having an

1:02:03: external URL to give the client. But would would you recommend let's say you don't have an affiliate link. Would you

1:02:08: recommend Lead Snap over something like Bright Local? All I can say is we use Lead Snap at my agency.

1:02:14: All right. All right. Great. Well, uh, I figure it'd be worth giving that one a try regardless. So, I'm I'm gonna do

1:02:20: that. And if we didn't have an affiliate link, I would still be using Lead Snap at at my agency. Like, it's it's a good tool.

1:02:27: Great. And And you use it for citation building? Almost excl We use it for the rank maps

1:02:33: and then we use it for citations. Yeah, the lead snap citations are they work.

1:02:39: They're very high quality. There's only like 50 of them, but you really don't need more than that. like the days where 200 like spammy citations that you

1:02:47: couldn't get indexed, those days are g gone. They don't really work unless it's a new GBP. Uh they help you get a new

1:02:53: GBP verified, but beyond that, they're a waste of time and money. Um so we switch

1:02:59: to Lead Snap because of the citations that it does. It's 20 bucks. It's one

1:03:05: time. It says monthly. And Patrick will probably be annoyed for me saying it's

1:03:10: one time because it says monthly, but they don't delete the citations if you cancel the subscription. So, it's a $20

1:03:16: onetime charge to do 51 highquality citations um an exact copy of your GBP

1:03:23: on Bing, on Apple, blah blah blah. We started using it and then I reached out to Patrick and was just like, "Hey, this

1:03:30: is great. Like, I want to recommend this tool. Uh it's better than the one that we had been uh that I had been

1:03:36: recommending." and he was like, "Okay, cool. Let me get you an affiliate link." But yeah, that's u it we started using

1:03:42: it before the affiliate, if that makes sense. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it does. Well, uh I

1:03:48: appreciate that. I'll let somebody else get on here. Always good talking to you, man. You too. Good to see you, Alex.

1:03:53: All right. Matthew asks again, "I don't need Well, so okay. I don't get why you don't why you need PBN links to get

1:03:59: indexed." So, if a website isn't indexed, it basically doesn't exist to Google. Only indexed websites exist. So,

1:04:06: if you have a link from a website that's not indexed, that is the exact same thing as not having a link at all. Okay,

1:04:13: that's all. Oh, I see what you're saying. Why you need PBN links to get your new content indexed. Gotcha. Hey,

1:04:21: if Google is indexing them and you're having success, don't worry about it. Uh, but honestly, um, often we'll

1:04:28: struggle to get a bunch of new content indexed. Uh, if you're not, that's awesome. uh even if it's high quality

1:04:35: content, even if the internal linking is correct and PBN links are just so inexpensive that we usually don't

1:04:41: bother. Um, yep, Victor and Elliot is correct. Um,

1:04:49: no, no, no. Uh, for for not for local SEO, Victor, we don't use guest posts. We don't use niche edits. We use the PBN

1:04:56: uh for new pages and we use local charity organizations, sponsorships,

1:05:04: uh chamber of commerce, uh that local type stuff to actually build trust and authority. Um uh the actual cost of a

1:05:12: PBN link on the ice cream truck shop, which is my PBN, uh it's about $30 a

1:05:19: piece. And on QGP, um,

1:05:27: I'm making a noise because I can't find it. Uh, I don't know. I'm not going to stop looking. Uh, look on QGP and find

1:05:34: out. We don't I don't buy PBN's from other sources because we have our own network. Uh, 25. Perfect. Yeah. So,

1:05:41: they're just if you have an SEO engagement with a new client, $25 to $30 a piece. Yeah. Um, uh, Victor, uh, sure,

1:05:49: you can mention something that, uh, or you can send me a message on school and let me know. Um, but yeah, sure. All

1:05:56: right, Billy. Man, you're far down on the list today. You're usually done.

1:06:01: Yeah, I Well, that happens. But, but now that you kind of go through it quicker, you don't have to be this first every

1:06:08: time now. But it used to be, but now not so much anymore. Hey, so so I I guess I have a good problem. I'm on my eighth

1:06:15: client for the website structure, the mirror. And so, yeah, it starts to get

1:06:21: confusing. So, now I'm looking at your internal client track. Sorry about that. That's my dogs. Uh, mailman's coming.

1:06:27: But yeah, so now I'm looking at the internal client tracking and uh I'm I I

1:06:33: got the the part about the client information is easy, but I'm almost glazing over. I'm looking at the

1:06:39: deliverables overview that section of it and how you put all that in there and maybe that's a lot more than what you

1:06:45: could cover right now. Maybe that's just whole other topic but yeah is I mean can

1:06:51: you walk us through how to do this and basically how to fill all the stuff out or is that beyond what we're doing here

1:06:57: today? Does that make sense? It does. Uh yes. So, let me see if I can

1:07:04: pull up a blank one cuz I I was I obviously don't want to share mine.

1:07:09: Yeah. Yeah. And and that's that's my problem. I don't want to sh mine. I got part stuff up there, so I don't want to show it. Does that make sense? I mean,

1:07:17: yeah. And I guess I'm sort of confused about all the stuff you put in and and and are you putting it in or you having

1:07:25: your your assistants put it all in? And does that sort of all make sense? Yep. Perfect. All right.

1:07:32: Here we go. I pulled it up. This is the one. Like I said, the client information stuff is pretty straightforward. It's the deliverables overview that I'm not

1:07:38: having confusion with. All right. So, the way that this generally works. Um, obviously we'll put

1:07:46: the client name here and that way we can filter by the actual client. And every month at the beginning of the month, uh,

1:07:53: we obviously know the clients that we have and we know how much content we're going to produce for them. So, we'd have

1:07:59: client information. So, we say for John Doe, uh, we're going to deliver four articles in the first month and eight

1:08:06: articles every month thereafter. So, we deliver things peacemeal. I don't want

1:08:11: the client to go a month without hearing from me and then drop eight articles on them at the last week of the month. So,

1:08:18: if we do eight a month, that means we're going to do about two articles per month ongoing. Uh, it's a little bit less.

1:08:23: It's like 1.9 or something because there's 4.3 weeks a month, but whatever.

1:08:28: Okay. So then at the beginning of the month, uh what uh my team will do is

1:08:34: they're going to say uh so so eight articles. They'll plan out what do we

1:08:39: want those eight articles to be? Are we going to do uh location content, neighborhood content, or supporting

1:08:46: content? So location content uh is just going to be right some of the geographical based content. Neighborhood

1:08:53: is another type of geographical content and supporting content is for topical relevance for the core 30. So we'll look

1:09:01: at the rank map. We'll say what does this client need? Does it need topical content or geographical content? And

1:09:07: then we'll say okay so let's say this client they need topical content. So we're going to do supporting content and

1:09:13: we're going to do eight articles uh per month. So that's three, four, five, 6,

1:09:20: 7, 8. So say we're doing this for September. Okay. So the first Friday in

1:09:28: September is September 5th. So then we're going to say this due date is

1:09:33: September 5th, not June 5th. Thank you, keyboard. I'll blame the keyboard for that. Yes, 2005. That's when it's due.

1:09:40: Thank you, keyboard. So those are going to due September 5th. Uh then this one will make do uh the next Friday and then

1:09:47: this one will make due the Friday after that. And then I don't why is it adjusting? I don't

1:09:53: want September 20th. Whatever. Um se September 19th and then this last two we

1:10:00: will make due the last Friday in September. Okay. So now my uh team who

1:10:08: sees this has access to this. They're going to see, okay, here's the content plan for this month for

1:10:15: John Doe. Okay. And we need eight supporting content articles due these

1:10:20: Fridays. So then, uh, the status of all of these are obviously going to be

1:10:26: planned, right? Because we haven't done anything yet. So then on every Monday uh my team uh

1:10:35: especially my my ma employee who manages the agency Destiny um she does a great

1:10:42: job. Uh so on so say today was Monday the 1st. Okay. So she is going to tell

1:10:48: the content writers to write these two supporting content articles and she's going to tell them what the content

1:10:54: should be, what the target keyword should be. So then she's going to turn these two in production because on

1:11:00: Monday she told them to write it. And then on Friday they're going to deliver that finished work and she's going to

1:11:07: say delivered needs approval. She's going to review it. Once she reviews it, she's going to say delivered. Okay? Now,

1:11:16: use fewer categories if it works for you, but that's how she manages the workflow to make sure that she is on top

1:11:24: of what uh the team is doing, what they need to do. She can come in here and look at any given moment and see all of

1:11:32: the content for the month. Uh what she has kicked over to the writing team, what she hasn't kicked over, what needs

1:11:38: to be reviewed, what needs to be posted. Uh we also have um yeah approved publishing that the client has approved

1:11:45: it. It's going straight to or it's going to the developer in revision. Um

1:11:51: delivered uh will be that we've sent it to the client. Uh in revision means that

1:11:56: the client has given us feedback that we've had to go and revise the content

1:12:02: for the client and then finally it gets ticked over to approve publishing and then eventually live. I don't know is

1:12:08: that helpful? Is that what you were hoping for? Yes. Yes, that that is helpful. So I

1:12:14: guess then it had you have a lot more columns up here and and so I'm trying to

1:12:19: follow the bouncing ball in all of it. Does that make sense? Yeah. And a lot of this and Victor's

1:12:25: asked about Asauna. A lot of these templates um when um because a sauna has

1:12:32: macros where it can automatically send out notifications. So a lot of the notifications this needs to get done,

1:12:37: this needs to get done, this needs to get done. A lot of that is integrated with the sauna also to uh help manage

1:12:44: this. Uh so a lot of it's manually done. Uh some of it is

1:12:50: done with the sauna and macros. Uh but yeah, this is basically how we manage it. So, if I look at it, I'm not going

1:12:57: to share my screen, but if I open the chart right now and uh for my agency, I

1:13:03: can see that we have content basically planned out through September 12th, uh a

1:13:09: bunch of service pages, which is the core 30 part of the service page. And

1:13:14: then in uh column G, what oh, then this is a good point. I should have pointed

1:13:20: this out. So, what what we will do I'm trying to find that article again. There

1:13:26: it is. Okay. So, link. Okay. So, let me let me let me pull this up real quick because this also might help. Um, boom.

1:13:33: Share. So, we'll link to this page content.

1:13:38: Share. Make a copy. And you'll see here we're going to give the title tag, uh,

1:13:44: the URL if there is one. Obviously, if it's a new URL, we won't. We'll give what the client's name is, when it's

1:13:51: due, any notes, any internal links, what the type of page is, and uh

1:13:57: what the target keyword is. So, these links will be in every one of these at

1:14:04: the beginning of the month, right? So, then when she says, "Hey, here's what we need to produce," uh the ASA will

1:14:12: trigger to send a link. uh hey, go check out the tracking sheet. And these links

1:14:17: will give all the information. It's a blank page of everything that needs to be done with all the information that

1:14:23: the content writer needs. And then they're going to say, "Okay, I'm done." By basically just filling in that blank

1:14:31: content sheet, right? So everything is managed from this spreadsheet if that

1:14:36: makes sense. Does that am I making sense? Yes. So So I'm going to be really stupid

1:14:42: here. What's Asana? I'm sorry. ASA is a task management software that helps like

1:14:48: it'll automatically send notifications and and stuff like that. Uh yeah, and Asauna integrates with Google Sheets. So

1:14:54: a lot of this is integrated Asauna integrated with Google Sheets in terms of how she manages that workflow. U if

1:15:02: that would if it would be helpful guys let me know. Uh we could maybe see if uh Destiny would be willing to give a more

1:15:08: detailed walkthrough. uh I am, you know, not nearly as familiar with how she

1:15:14: manages it as she is because she manages it and I don't.

1:15:20: That would be very helpful if if she sort of gave a tutorial then I could have my assistant watch that and so it's

1:15:27: not relying on me if that sort of makes sense. Yeah, let me make a note and we'll see if we can uh get that worked

1:15:33: out because me trying to explain it's tough, but assistant to assistant would be much

1:15:39: better if that makes sense. Or, you know, maybe we could uh see if uh she'd be willing to do a quick

1:15:45: recording and we can just add it to the training. Um that'd be great, too. But yeah, cool. All right, John, how are

1:15:52: you? Good. Thank you. Thank you for all the the value you're giving. It's been awesome.

1:15:57: Appreciate it. Yeah, man. Yeah. So my question, I'm a little different than I think almost everybody here is I'm a local realtor in Durango,

1:16:04: Colorado. Um, and I'm just doing this for myself and trying to figure all this out and learn. Um, and so my plan right

1:16:10: now is I'm creating 180ish pages, basically community or

1:16:16: neighborhood pages. Um, I'm making sure that it's only three clicks away. I think you spoke about that at one point.

1:16:23: And essentially when you go in there, I have like 30 created so far. when you go in there, it's going to have some bullet

1:16:29: point stuff, but what we need to create now is the SEO rich content. I don't

1:16:35: know the right verbiage, but the 50 to 100 words, I think is what you said. And I think my question basically is

1:16:44: anything that I need to make sure because it's such a big project, anything I need to make sure I'm getting

1:16:49: correct and not or not doing, etc. like with within that scope or am I going

1:16:56: down the wrong No. So, what I've seen u have a lot of success with real estate agents is

1:17:03: similar to what you're describing where it's basically an article about like a subdivision or something like that that

1:17:09: talks about that subdivision and why that's a good place to live, etc., etc. Because, you know, often people who are

1:17:16: searching for subdivision names on Google are thinking about buying a house there. So yeah, that strategy has

1:17:21: worked. Uh we've seen it work really well. Um that is how I recommend all real estate agents build their website.

1:17:28: U most of them don't for some reason. Um but yeah. Uh and basically we would

1:17:34: build uh some page that we'd link to from the header or the footer uh that would say like subdivisions in this

1:17:41: city. And then we just you know have you know maybe 500 words, 600 words that

1:17:47: talks about the city as a whole. uh maybe some brief mentions of some of the big subdivisions and then just like a

1:17:53: long list of links. Cool. And then within that you're having um I think you said something about well

1:17:59: the whole I forget the guy that did it where is the Lauren Ipsum and he ranks number one. Is there certain do I

1:18:05: basically need to have that subdivision 10 times or not too many times or what am I kind of shooting for in that so it

1:18:12: actually ranks? I'm not maybe I'm not uh say more like why would you have the

1:18:17: same subdivision 10 times right? Oh sorry in within so you click on Dalton Ranch for example then you've got

1:18:22: your 50 to 100 words on that one page. My question is how do I make sure that

1:18:28: ranks most effectively like do I need that those words peppered in? I see. So okay yeah and Jeremy helped to

1:18:35: clarify also. Um so we don't worry a whole lot about keyword density anymore.

1:18:42: um it's not unimportant. So if it is something that you want to Yep. Jeremy

1:18:47: Jeremy beat me to it. If it is something that you want to really focus on, then uh the tool that we use to check the

1:18:54: word density keyword usage is page optimizer pro. Uh because it's a lot more than just your target keyword. It's

1:19:01: also a lot of LSI keywords, semantically related keywords. My favorite example,

1:19:07: right, is if you're trying to rank for Star Wars, you couldn't rank for Star Wars by just putting Star Wars in a

1:19:13: whole bunch of times because Google would know to look for relevant terms to make sure it's actually comprehensive

1:19:19: authoritative content. So, you would want to talk about lightsabers and Luke Luke Skywalker and General Orana and all

1:19:27: the other characters from Star Wars in order to rank for Star Wars. and Google would look for those different words uh

1:19:33: like the using its language analysis pattern. So, page optimizer pro will take a look at the current ranking

1:19:39: websites and then give you the language patterns that they're using so that you can mimic it in your content. It was

1:19:47: developed by this uh gentleman named Kyle Roof. Um

1:19:52: and he the first iteration of the tool he was participating in a local SEO

1:19:58: competition. Uh, do you know the story, John? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The the Lauren Ipsum.

1:20:03: Yeah. And he ranked for Rhinoplasty Plano with Lauramipum content. Uh, using

1:20:08: a version of Page Optimizer Pro. So, we've basically been using it ever since and it works well.

1:20:14: Sweet. Thank you. And real quick, chamber links. What would you What did you say about chamber links? You said it

1:20:20: needs to have some kind of uh verbiage. No. So, uh, the best type of link from a

1:20:25: chamber is just a normal text do follow link. If, uh, your chamber only does no

1:20:32: follow links, which I've seen, or if your chamber does some sort of weird JavaScript pop-up link thing, which I've

1:20:39: also seen, uh, usually we don't join those. We'll join other chambers that just use plain text links. Yeah.

1:20:46: Thank you so much. Cool. Appreciate it. Tim, how you doing?

1:20:51: Good, man. Can you hear me? I sure can. Okay, I'm on. Uh, so yeah, I got a uh

1:20:57: client. He's right outside of Nashville in the suburb. It's only 19 miles from downtown, but it is its own probably

1:21:04: city, so he probably can't rank in the uh his Google business profile there for

1:21:09: Nashville, right? So, I I can't say for sure without looking at it in more detail, but 95%

1:21:18: no, he can't. Okay. So he does in the future want to get he understands that wants to get a

1:21:24: uh address in Nashville. Nashville is most of all his business. Um so he I

1:21:31: guess I would ultimately just have to build out his current one for Hendersonville using Hendersonville

1:21:36: after all the categories and services. Correct. Y and then once he gets Nashville just do

1:21:41: the second location scenario. So, if he's not currently ranked,

1:21:49: um, usually what Go ahead. Well, he's he's not he does have a

1:21:54: website. He's only been in business for a year, but he's not ranking on like the top 30 or 40 for any keywords in

1:21:59: Hendersonville, but he's getting gangbuster reviews like daily. Insane. Growing like I've never seen.

1:22:06: That's awesome. So, you have a decision here. Obviously, it's going to be easier to rank in Hendersonville than Nashville, but the most powerful URL on

1:22:15: almost any domain is the homepage. And the strength of the GBP landing page is

1:22:22: a factor for ranking, right? So, if he's just like, I am 100% sure that I am

1:22:28: going to create a GBP in Nashville and he's not currently ranking at all, I

1:22:34: would think about whether the long-term strategy makes sense to use his homepage

1:22:40: for his Nashville landing page. It will be much easier to rank in the more competitive space of Nashville using his

1:22:47: homepage as the landing page. The downside of that is, of course, then his homepage talks about Nashville and you'd

1:22:54: create a new page for his current existing GBP, which will make his

1:22:59: current one harder to rank, right? But will make Nashville easier to rank in the future. So, that's something that

1:23:06: I would weigh is like, okay, do am I am I okay making it harder on me now, but

1:23:13: for the benefit of being easier to rank in Nashville, or do I just want a quick win? Let me rank in this suburb using my

1:23:20: homepage and then Nashville is going to be a real pain using an internal page to try to rank from.

1:23:25: So, Nashville won't do anything now though until he gets that G GBP. Correct? Yeah. the Nashville homepage.

1:23:32: Nashville is the homepage will only hurt you now because you're not using it right for the GP.

1:23:37: Well, his most of his plans are LSI ads, so I think he'll probably go with that that route. Um, I saw the DGP mention

1:23:45: for the $25 PBN links. What is the DGP URL? What does that stand for? QGP.

1:23:52: Huge. Q. The letter Q Guppy

1:23:58: promo. Yep, that's what I came up with. QGP. I came up with Queen Guppy promo. I have no idea what it stands for.

1:24:04: Quality. But that's URL though. Yeah, it says QGP.com. They sell I haven't bought all of their

1:24:11: links. You can't vouch for vote for everything, but they sell uh pretty inexpensive uh decently good links.

1:24:19: Okay. And what I dropped it wasn't even an affiliate link. They have an early program. I'm not uh it was just it was

1:24:26: just a straight up link. So, one more question about the um the way he has his category set up. It's a

1:24:32: cleaning business. He deals with house cleaning, business cleaning, construction cleaning. Cleaners is his main keyword. So, you put cleaners as

1:24:39: the primary keyword in the Google business profile, but all of the service keywords would fit under the silos of

1:24:46: each of the three subcategories, right? Would you put anything under the main

1:24:51: cleaners one in the Google business profile or just leave that empty? We would put the couple of as long as

1:24:57: they're relevant, the couple of services that they really, really care about, right? So for a plumber, we would put

1:25:03: water heater replacement and main drain line under the plumber category in the GBP. All the other services would go

1:25:09: under their other categories. And then we would link on the homepage, we would link to their secondary

1:25:15: categories and those two key services. So, if they're a house cleaner, then

1:25:20: you'd probably have like house cleaning service as a service they really care about. So, we'd link to that from the

1:25:26: homepage and we'd have that service underneath their primary category. Okay.

1:25:32: Not more than like a couple of them because otherwise we'll delude with too many links. Yeah.

1:25:37: And then Robert, yes, you're right. Quality guest post. Excellent. And sorry Tim, we said that uh one no follow-up

1:25:45: questions so that everyone I know you weren't you weren't with us at at the

1:25:50: weren't with you. Okay. Uh but if you raise your hand again, we'll see because I'm trying to rush through. I got to go get the kiddos. But

1:25:56: Davidid is back. How are you, man? I'm back. Yes, I'm good. Thank you. Uh I

1:26:02: have a question about again about the silo and um well, so let me let me look at this real

1:26:08: quick. This is finished. This is the heat map for the optometrist in Houston. Um, and hopefully this is helpful. So,

1:26:15: uh, for more than so the, and this is another reason that I like lead snap a lot is it's going to pull up the rank

1:26:21: maps for everyone. So, I can click on any one of these businesses and see the rank map immediately instead of uh, in

1:26:28: addition to the one that I actually wanted to pull up. And the other thing that's really cool is the top 3%. So

1:26:35: this eye center of Houston, 35 12% of this map is in the top three. And I can

1:26:40: actually sort by the top 3%. 35 1.5 18% 18% 10 10. So what this tells me Devid

1:26:47: when I look at this cuz these are low numbers, right? It's not uncommon that we'll see businesses that have 80% 90%

1:26:55: in the top three. Uh but for the number one player to be 35% that tells me that

1:27:00: this is probably a very very competitive search. But Google is really rewarding

1:27:07: uh searchers who are close to the address, which makes sense cuz right if

1:27:12: you're in Houston and this is only the west side of Houston, right? But like if

1:27:17: you're here, uh the the the drive from here to here is like an hour and most

1:27:24: people aren't going to drive an hour to see an optometrist. So Google is really rewarding uh the proximity for this

1:27:32: particular search. That's one of the reasons this top three is quite low. Uh, and you can see another thing that it

1:27:38: calculates is market share. So, it it's using some AI things and

1:27:44: math to figure this out, but this is it's trying to be a measure of how much

1:27:50: like if you were perfect, how much of the market could you possibly rank for?

1:27:55: So, this tool at least has decided that you can't do better than I center of Houston. And maybe that's wrong. Um, but

1:28:02: then these other ones are basically how well are they ranking based on this market share. Um, so anyway, when I look

1:28:10: at this, I would say that if you have a client uh for Optometrist Houston, your

1:28:17: best goal is going to be to hit 10 to 20, maybe 25% of the rank map being

1:28:25: green. And that's about as good as they're going to get.

1:28:30: Okay. Yeah, I think I think he will be happy with that already.

1:28:36: All right. What is your new question? Sorry, I just had to. Thank you. Thank you for that's helpful.

1:28:43: um about silo because uh it's again something I was thinking uh in term of

1:28:48: logic you know last week we talked about silo first uh for the geographic

1:28:54: relevance is there the silo matters uh like the other silo like topical

1:29:00: relevance and also for the landing page I mean if I follow the logic uh the landing page doesn't follow the

1:29:07: the silo structure you know because you have a bit of service a bit of category and then that's linked that doesn't I

1:29:14: mean everything links back to it. So do you see what I mean? If I follow the logic I would do one first page with all

1:29:21: only the category and then each each category which has their own silo and the geographic relevance I don't know.

1:29:28: Yeah. Do you understand? Agreed. Agreed. So the two couple of services that will often pull up to the homepage, they have to be relevant for

1:29:34: the primary category, right? Like if the primary category is HVAC contractor, I'm not going to pull water heater

1:29:40: replacement, even if a second category is plumber. So the couple of core services that we pull

1:29:47: up to the homepage, that's just to make uh to help them rank faster for the services they really really care about

1:29:53: and they are going to be 100% relevant uh to the primary category to make sure

1:30:00: we're not breaking those topical silos. Is that does that help?

1:30:06: Yes, that's help. But and what about the geographic? Uh geographic doesn't follow the same rules. No, the geographic stuff

1:30:11: just basically lives off to the side because what we're doing for the geographic stuff is it's going to be whatever keyword that we're trying to

1:30:18: rank for geographically plus the geographic landmark plus the city name, right? So, most of the time it's just

1:30:25: primary category most of the time. Um, and then we'll have a locations page or

1:30:31: something off to the side and we'll have all the geographic stuff because it's just going to be primary category over and over and over again just having all

1:30:38: the different geographic mentions. But the geographic will be only on the the primary category page and then it's

1:30:45: still a silo. You still follow the silo. All of the geographic pages basically are their own silo. Yeah. But they might

1:30:52: not all be the primary category. Like again, if you're looking at a plumber and they're ranking for plumber but not

1:30:59: for water heater replacement, then we might do geographical content about water heater replacement to try to get

1:31:04: them rank for that search term in the specific areas depending on what the rank maps are showing.

1:31:11: Okay. Okay, perfect. Thank you. Sure. Billy, what's up, man? Yeah. Uh, quick question. So, I want to

1:31:18: talk about the different locations. So you have your Google business profile uh uh mainly

1:31:26: going from let's say Miami and then you're building a page then you're doing another location page in Orlando then

1:31:33: you do another one in Tampa right so are you going out and get super citations for each of those locations

1:31:40: each of the three does that make sense 100% absolutely without question

1:31:46: super citations are $20 like yes yeah so you do for each of the each your

1:31:52: Google business profile landing pages. You go out and do the super citations and do you go out and get the the local

1:31:58: geographic ones for the chamber for each one of those locations, right? Am I on am I am I on the right

1:32:05: track? 100%. Yep. Got it. Okay. And then as far as the if

1:32:10: I got this right for let's say I have those three locations, then I have to go out and get my uh uh uh secondary

1:32:17: categories and service niches for each of those. So, if I was doing those three, I I'm looking at 90 right now.

1:32:23: Correct. Exactly. But watch your rank map because the core 30 establishes topical

1:32:29: relevance and you usually won't need 90 pages to establish topical relevance. So

1:32:35: eventually Google will just start to trust that domain that like yes, that domain they're good for plumbing or

1:32:42: whatever your primary category is. So maybe it's your third location, maybe it's your fifth location, but eventually

1:32:48: you'll go to add a GBP and you'll run a rank map and that GBP will be 20, 30,

1:32:54: 40% green and you'll be like, man, I don't need to build any of the core 30 because the domain has enough topical

1:33:00: relevance already. Got it. Okay, thank you. Absolutely. Victor,

1:33:06: how are you? I don't remember. Is this your first time here? Hey, Caleb, what's going on? Yeah, it's my first time here. All right. So, I can

1:33:13: remember some things. What's going on, man? What you got? Yeah. So, basically, you know, um I've

1:33:19: been turning down a lot of clients that don't have a WordPress website and I've been doing that for quite a while. Yeah.

1:33:26: So, um I just kind of want to know your approach on that cuz some clients like

1:33:31: they would have a Wix website or maybe some other type of platform and my team or myself is not trained on that. So,

1:33:38: you know, like what what would you do instead of turning down that client?

1:33:44: Uh, I would get somebody who can work on that platform. Like, uh, Wix is a guey

1:33:51: builder, so it's usually pretty easy to use. Um, I have a the

1:33:57: developer that we use for most of the projects. He can pretty much work any

1:34:03: platform. And in my experience, uh, there aren't very many developers who

1:34:10: are really good at WordPress, but they won't be able to do Web Flow or Wix or

1:34:16: Weebly or Square or the Highlevel website builder or the GoDaddy website

1:34:22: builder, etc., etc., etc., because all of those builders are usually much

1:34:28: simpler than WordPress. Uh so yeah, I have one developer and he just he

1:34:34: doesn't care what platform the website is on. Yeah. Yeah. Cuz um I up until now I've

1:34:41: been getting the client to invest in like a new website and then you know and

1:34:47: not all of them want to do that. Um so I have to like charge you know uh

1:34:52: appropriately for building out a new website. But then at the same time, we're building out the pages and um

1:35:00: doing it the right way so they can rank faster as well. So it kind of works out

1:35:06: okay, but I also definitely push away a lot of clients, too. Uh and what's what's also

1:35:13: interesting about that, right, is again depending on how they're ranking when you get started,

1:35:18: um when we rebuild a website, we almost always see a drop in rank, right? Google

1:35:24: hates uh when you change any website and um we've seen where you know it's super

1:35:32: common that like a marketing agency and SEO agency will hold the website hostage. So we'll rebuild a client's website to

1:35:39: look exactly the same on the exact same platform using the same images, same

1:35:45: content, launch the new website and their rank drops. Um, Google just

1:35:50: doesn't like new websites, even if everything about them is exactly the same. So, if a client is ranking, uh,

1:35:58: like we we've had clients come to us like, "Oh, my website is on Web Flow. Should I move it to WordPress? Let me

1:36:04: look at your rank map. Okay, your average rank position is nine." No, you should not move it because if you move

1:36:09: it, your average rank position is going to be 20 plus and then we have to start over. Like I will almost never want a

1:36:14: client to move or update website design uh or anything like that because

1:36:21: yeah even just like hey let's launch a new website design rank drops like it it always drops. So most of my clients have

1:36:28: websites that look like they're 15 years old because their websites are 15 years old. That being said, and we actually

1:36:35: have tested this, we've seen this where if you have a local business website and they launch a brand new slick website

1:36:42: that looks like like Apple's website, like it's really nice and shiny and brand new, uh we'll actually usually see

1:36:49: lower conversions. Um once the traffic recovers, we'll see lower conversions.

1:36:55: Uh, and when we've tested this, the best conversions that we see for local business websites are typically uh

1:37:02: websites that look like they're 10 to 15 years old. Uh, those convert really well

1:37:08: for a local business. Like ugly websites, they're not built super well, but hey, they convert, so we're

1:37:15: going to keep them. Yeah. Good question, though. Um, the developer that we use, I

1:37:20: found him on Upwork years and years ago. I just posted a job for just I think I

1:37:26: called it something like generalized website development work. Uh and when I

1:37:31: was talking with them uh I made sure that he was platform agnostic. Yeah. Got it. The name of the project

1:37:38: was remote developer for a range of projects. Super

1:37:43: super excellent title. Obviously uh you're probably jealous of how good I am

1:37:49: at naming projects. That's pretty spectacular. And I guess not don't move over a site,

1:37:55: right? You like you just mentioned, don't don't uh if it's ranking, uh don't move it from Wix to WordPress because

1:38:02: that could really We don't move anything. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Uh and since I hired this guy, he's been

1:38:08: with us for years since I said uh he has worked 3,000 uh 231 hours.

1:38:15: Yeah. Okay. um on a variety of he's a remote developer and he worked on a

1:38:21: variety of projects. Yeah. All right, Tim, last one. What's up, man? It better be good. No pressure.

1:38:27: Um well, just back to that uh when you're talking about putting Nashville as the homepage, would I on the keywords

1:38:33: below it for that homepage, would I put on Nashville service, Nashville

1:38:38: category? I mean, category N. Okay. Because those aren't really linking to anything. They're not linking to the

1:38:44: Hendersonville one. though. No, they wouldn't link to the Hendersonville one. So the Hendersonville one,

1:38:49: there's no linking going from that page. Yep. Yeah. Okay. And then I So he on the

1:38:55: house cleaning he has three packages, you know, like standard, deep, and in move in andout clean. Would you put

1:39:02: those the service keywords underneath those links or would you just have them

1:39:08: all attached to the category page of house cleaning services?

1:39:14: Does that make sense? So, uh, I would probably want to get an understanding of like, so depending on

1:39:21: how many secondary categories he Are you okay? What's going on? Okay. Okay. Uh, I he this he's been

1:39:31: chilling with me. Anyway, um, super cool. I would want to understand how many secondary categories are on his website

1:39:38: before uh deciding how many services we three. So then you can probably keep

1:39:43: like two services. Um, and that would be a conversation with the client like, "Hey, which of these do you like the

1:39:49: most? Uh, which one does he get calls for? Which one? Like does he like doing one or the other? Does he not care?" Um,

1:39:57: I mean, for house cleaners that we've worked at in the past, um, they typically don't like the move in or the

1:40:04: move out cleanings very much. Uh, cuz that's very often like a one-time thing. and they would much rather have hey a

1:40:11: few hundred bucks a week and then as long as they do well then it's their client for years. Uh that's you know

1:40:17: much higher lifetime val value and then they like the movein cleanings for the same reason because if they do a good

1:40:22: job on the move in it can often roll into a long-term thing but less likely

1:40:28: than just someone who's like hey I'm looking for a long-term house cleaner. You know what I mean right? Yeah. Yeah. Totally.

1:40:34: So that's sort of the discussion of you know what types of calls does he want? what types of jobs does he want? Uh you

1:40:39: can do some uh asking of chat GPT uh go like have chat GPT look at some house

1:40:45: cleaning forms on Reddit uh like what types of jobs are most profitable to them uh over the long term and then just

1:40:53: to decide which ones to prioritize, which ones to optimize. Well, and I was specifically talking

1:40:59: about with like right there under the house cleaning because he does business cleaning, construction cleaning. So, three subcategories,

1:41:05: but then on the house cleaning, he's got those three packages. But the question is, do you put the services underneath

1:41:11: the packages, standard cleaning and deep cleaning, or directly to the house cleaning?

1:41:16: Oh, well, I would make the package the service, right? The service, like if you have a package, I would make a service

1:41:22: match the package name like it's a service and the package. Yeah. But to get the 30 core 30 though, I got

1:41:27: to add more to that underneath that. So, usually Yeah. Yeah. So, I was

1:41:33: there's a lot more that you can add. Yeah. Well, you know, I actually interviewed him like I was he was pitching me. He described all his

1:41:39: services, but I'm just wondering if I should put him under the standard cleaning and the uh deep cleaning or

1:41:46: like underneath them directly or to the house cleaning itself directing directly

1:41:52: attached to the house cleaning. So, what are the secondary categories? Just deep cleaning and standard

1:41:57: cleaning. So, those are secondary categories. Well, no, they're not categories. I'm

1:42:02: sorry. They're just uh they're his services. They're the actual plans he offers as a name of the plan.

1:42:08: So, I mean, don't put services underneath plans. Maybe I'm not following the question.

1:42:14: Well, when they call, he just offers three packages of Yep. here's what I do for house cleaning. So,

1:42:19: I'm just wondering if the extra services I'm going to add, you know, oven cleaning or bathroom cleaning or if they

1:42:25: should be connected directly to the house cleaning subcategory, whereas the

1:42:31: packages are directed or underneath the sub the deep cleaning or the house or the standard cleaning,

1:42:36: right? If there's a different secondary category that you can link them to and they be relevant, I would go there.

1:42:43: Okay, so that does Okay, that's all about that. All right, we are past time and sorry Muhammad, I do have to go.

1:42:51: Otherwise, the school will be very upset with me for uh not picking up my children. Uh but Muhammad, please uh

1:42:58: send me a message on school and I will get back to you with a bit more detail.
