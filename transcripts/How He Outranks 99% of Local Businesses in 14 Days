0:00: Yeah, I think it's streaming to both. So, I think we're live now. All right. Yep. I see the little uh eye

0:07: dot up there. I don't see anything because I'm all over the place. Well, we are live. Um

0:12: and we no matter how smart or stupid you are, it'll Oh, here we go. Here we are.

0:19: Hey, the first time I went live on YouTube, uh the first five minutes were me fussing around cursing, and then it

0:25: was just like, "Oh, I'm live right now." Oh. Oh, hi. Yeah, that just happens. That's just one

0:32: of those things that just happens. I'm actually looking to make sure that you're being able to be seen and you're not. So, let me change this around.

0:39: There you are. Okay, now.

0:45: All right, let me click in here. All right, cool.

0:51: All right, so people will people will eventually come on if they have their notifications on. Um, no problem. Or

0:57: they gave up on us. They gave up on us considering the fact

1:02: that we're 15, 16 minutes late. So, awesome. So, first of all, if you're here, welcome. Um,

1:08: I what I wanted to do is I get a lot of questions on my own channel about ranking and SEO and, you know, how to

1:15: rank in the new age. How do you rank in everything from you know organic to maps

1:22: to uh AI ranking in chat GBT and all the LLMs that is out there. So I thought

1:30: what better person to bring on than Caleb Uku who is uh the king of SEO and always I

1:37: mean I've known you for how many years now? Since 2018. Yeah. 2018.

1:44: from one program to another program and now we have our own programs, right? Or you have your own program.

1:51: Yeah, you you had yours when we met, but yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Sweet. So, a few things I guess

1:57: while we're I'm looking at the chat. Um, so you guys can Crystal Scott is your

2:03: number one viewer. I think I'm on your channel actually. I am on your channel. That's funny. Um,

2:09: Robbie is the first. So, you guys could drop uh any questions you have while we

2:15: go through some of this ranking and and local business stuff, but uh I'm going to hand it over to Caleb, but I'm going

2:21: to jump in probably a lot because I tend to to do that and probably annoy the living hell out of them. And so,

2:27: please absolutely. Yeah. And so, look, to be honest with you, Caleb, I you've grown your YouTube

2:32: what, 10 15,000 subscribers in the last what, six to 12 months, something like that. I'd have to look,

2:38: but yeah. spitting out content every week. Every single week. Yeah.

2:45: Not easy. I often joke that man, if you're starting a new YouTube channel, it's great if you've had it for a couple of

2:51: years, but for the first six months or so, no one watches your content except your video editor and like your mom.

2:58: Yeah. No, it's it's not easy. people who are just starting YouTube is it's not

3:04: easy unless you have like high production and I don't even know like high production

3:11: and you're hitting a huge trend that is hot right now. That's I've only seen a handful of times like

3:19: somebody hitting a big video in the first handful. It usually just takes a long time of slowly building watch time

3:25: and staying with it and eventually hopefully getting it. But yeah, so um

3:31: but not here to talk about YouTube. Um no, here to talk about SEO stuff, right?

3:38: Yes. So let's do it. I can tell you one thing before you start is um I've always

3:43: turned to to you for SEO stuff. Um matter and the funny part is I got

3:49: involved in a local or the agency with SEO. That was like my my first big

3:54: client was an SEO client, a mortgage company. I tell this story all the time that I charge five grand a month for it

4:00: and couldn't rank a site. Um I mean I went through hell in high waters to get that site ranked, but when you're

4:07: competing with like Chase and Bank of America and you know aggregators like

4:14: Yelp and all that stuff, it's uh I promise the world and very very under underdel. Um

4:21: well it so I will have you heard the story of my first big client in SEO? No,

4:26: actually. So, my first big client in SEO was an app development company in India. So, a

4:33: company in India hired me to do their SEO. And they hired me to do their SEO. This was a time when I really didn't

4:39: even know what SEO stood for. This is back in 2015, 2016. I was just getting

4:45: started. Had no idea. And much like you said, I was just like, "Yes, I can do all of this." I I didn't promise

4:51: rankings. I promised that we would get them a ton of links. Uh, so we started getting all those links and then one day

4:58: Google deindexed their entire domain, which pretty much is about as bad as it

5:04: gets with SEO. U, so that that that was my first client. Uh, but that was 10

5:09: years ago. Uh, I've learned a few more things about SEO in the uh, intervening 10 years. Uh, and of course, huge

5:16: changes in the world of search optimization started in November of 2022.

5:23: And James, you know what happened in November of 2022? Yeah. Chat GPT.

5:29: Chat GPT three and a half rolled out. Uh before chat GPT had come out, the focus

5:35: at my agency was almost exclusively on non-local SEO. uh but three and a half

5:40: came out we started you know playing with it and my agency using it and it

5:46: was pretty clear even back then thatformational type non-local searches

5:52: were not the way to make money online anymore chat GPT was going to take over

5:59: uh writing on was on the wall uh since then that's of course happened Google has introduced its own AI overview but

6:07: uh when we saw how powerful chat GPT3 and a half was we switched and really

6:12: focused on local SEO starting in early 2024. So February, March started

6:19: focusing on local SEO. Uh so I had a a phone sales guy started running some

6:26: Facebook ads uh just to see if we could get some local businesses, get them on the phone, talk to them, pitch them on

6:33: local SEO. And I remember uh one morning my sales guy reaches out to me and he's

6:39: like, "Hey, Caleb, I have a plumber on the phone uh or I have a plumber scheduled this afternoon." Uh it was our

6:46: first one. I was like, "Oh, that's awesome. I'm really excited. First call with the local business owner. That's going to be really exciting. Let me know

6:52: how it goes." And he was like, "Well, hold on, Caleb. What do you want me to talk to him about?" We didn't have an offer. We

6:59: didn't have pricing. He was like, "What do you want me to talk to this guy about?" So, we were just like, man, uh,

7:05: just talk to him, figure out what he needs, right? He saw an ad on Facebook and booked a call with a random

7:11: stranger, so he obviously needs something. So, just talk to him, figure out what it is. Uh, so for the next three months, he

7:19: was getting on the phone with, you know, 15 to 20 plumbers. They're all plumbers. 15 to 20 plumbers a week. Uh, four or

7:27: five calls a day. And over that intervening time, we developed our

7:32: offer, changed it, split tested it, developed it, and then we finally hit on an offer that worked. Uh 6 months after

7:40: that, we had landed 97 plumbers as clients. Uh and we basically were using

7:46: all AI to rank them. uh offer that we were giving them. We're building them a

7:52: new website. We're getting them a new GBP and then using AI content, we were ranking the website, ranking the GBP.

7:59: So, let's see if this works. Uh unfortunately, the ranking tool uh updated, so I can no longer share the

8:06: the native tool without giving away the client name. And every time I've given away a client name on YouTube, um

8:13: bad things happen. So it's going to be a a screenshot before the interface was

8:19: updated. But anyway, so this is the before. Uh this is what they looked like. This is you can see the date

8:25: February 16th. Uh and then I have to stop sharing. And then let me share the

8:31: after. So this is the after and again you can date. This is March

8:37: 1st. This is two weeks later. Um, the average rank position went from 17 and a

8:42: half to 2.3. Can you Can you bring up the previous one because I didn't have you I I have to add the screen share when you do it.

8:49: Oh, you have to add. No problem. So, I'll bring up the previous one unless you So, this is the previous one. This was

8:55: uh February 16th. Uh, average rank 17 and a half. So, in two weeks it was all red to all

9:03: green basically. and the method we used so we started landing

9:10: local SEO clients didn't have a huge amount of local SEO experience no problem uh so we started like we we had

9:17: been doing SEO since 2015 2016 we've done SEO for uh Adobe Black & Decker uh

9:25: Skillshare so we've done SEO for big companies uh big non-local businesses hadn't done local before so we really

9:32: had to fine-tune our local SEO process. So, we used the same basic process that

9:39: we used with non-local. We just adapted it to local SEO and I'm pretty convinced

9:46: I've watched a lot of YouTube about SEO. I I don't think there's anyone else who was talking about this method when I

9:53: started talking about it. Now, they might be because some of my videos have a, you know, a few views here and there,

10:00: uh, but it's relatively new. So the overall method that we talk about, we

10:06: call it internally, we call it the core 30. Um, so if you go and you look at a

10:12: Google business profile, the business profile is going to have a primary category. Uh, Google allows up to 10

10:19: categories total, but you have to have at least one. Uh, our recommendation is that you have three or four categories.

10:26: Obviously, they have to be relevant. Don't choose, you know, something random. Choose something relevant. So

10:32: for plumber uh which is the one that we've worked with a lot we often do plumber as the primary uh then we have a

10:38: drain services provider and uh gas contractor or whatever it's called something like that for the three

10:44: categories. Then on top of those three categories we want to have 20 to 30

10:50: services. Now a GBP service is an free entry box. You can type anything you

10:56: want in there. the categories, you need to select one specifically that Google recognizes, but you can put anything you

11:02: want in the in the in the white box for the services. So that gives you, you know, 20 to 25 services, three or four

11:09: categories, that gives you 30 pages. That's what we call the core 30. Uh, and what we want to do when we're building

11:16: this out is we want to build the website so that the website structure exactly

11:21: matches the GBP, right? So the closer we can get the website to match the GBP, uh

11:28: the more trust, the more authority we build with Google's algorithm, uh because then Google is more and more

11:35: convinced that yes, this is a real business and this business is associated

11:40: with this Google business profile. Right? Let me I'm trying to see if I can

11:46: pull up a pull up a map, a little uh map. And I I actually we you and I were

11:52: going through this with that electrician client uh with me when um about the core

11:57: 30 and like building from the main like what it is electrician and then I don't

12:03: know if you have like a a like a what the hell they call not not

12:08: like a graph of how it works like found it. Got it. Okay. Yes. It's a PowerPoint slide. I'm an

12:15: engineer by training so of course it's just a crappy PowerPoint slide. Uh yeah,

12:21: so this is in my in my school community where we break everything down, but let me let me talk through this. So um the

12:27: most important URL for a local business website is we call it the GBP landing page. So if you go to your GBP, if you

12:35: go to your GBP, there's a box that says website. Whatever URL you put in that box is your GBP landing page. For most

12:42: local businesses, it's just going to be their homepage. For a multilocation business, it should not be the homepage.

12:48: It'll be an internal page. But anyway, so you have the internal or you have the GBP landing page, the homepage. Now,

12:55: this is the target keyword. So the target keyword on the homepage is your primary category city name. So for fun,

13:02: we'll just say plumber Houston, right? So uh homepage keyword target keyword is

13:08: plumber Houston. Then from the homepage, we're going to link to the secondary

13:14: categories. So we link to the category secondary category 1, secondary category 2, secondary category 3. We also leave

13:22: room to link to a couple of critical services. So these are like the absolute

13:28: most important services that you or your client care about. So for a plumber,

13:33: this is going to be water heater replacement and it's going to be main drain line replacement. Right? Those two

13:38: services probably represent 80 to 90% of most plumbers profits. Right? plumbers

13:44: don't actually want to deal with clogged toilets or leaky faucets. They want to deal with a water heater replacement or

13:50: main drain line. So, we're going to bring these right up and link to it from the homepage. So, the way that we do

13:55: this when we think about the GBP landing page, we're going to have um H2s, which

14:01: is subheadings, and each subheading is going to be the secondary category and city name. So, it's going to be

14:06: something like Go ahead. No, I was going to say so like in my like in my my simple to think brain when you say

14:14: linking like are you saying like you know how like you have the you have your

14:19: homepage and then you have the top where it says like services it says you know about about us uh locations yada yada is

14:27: that where am I looking at this like category one would be one of those or

14:32: you're just talking about linking like where do these categories go? Then they go into

14:37: So these are not navbar links. These are plain text links in the text of the

14:43: homepage. Got it. Right. Okay. Your homepage has a subheading for this subcategory. Um right, uh gas work for a

14:52: plumber. And then under that subheading, uh you'll have 60 70 80 words that

14:58: briefly describes what you do, how you do it for that category. In that

15:04: paragraph, you're going to have a link to another URL, right? So each one of these boxes is a URL, and the lines

15:12: connecting them are internal text links. Got it? So you'll have a link from your homepage

15:17: to category one. And on category one, you're going to have 1500 words about

15:23: that category. And on this page, you're also going to have a bunch of subheadings for all of the services

15:29: relevant to this category. Okay, give me an example. So

15:35: let the So if you have a a plumber that you're talking about natural gas work,

15:40: maybe one of your services is a new oven installation, a new fireplace installation, and uh front lantern

15:47: installation. Yeah. So on your category page, you're going to have a little subheading where like

15:54: oven installation and then you're going to have 60 70 words about oven installation with a link to a deep uh

16:02: long form page about oven installation. Do the same thing, same thing. Repeat,

16:07: repeat, repeat, repeat. And this is why we call it the core 30 because with your 20 to 25 services uh three four five

16:15: categories you end up with around 30 pages to to build this out. So when

16:21: you're done every category and every service on your GBP is going to have a

16:27: URL that has the exact category or service on the title tag on the H1. So

16:35: then when Google crawls your site, it says, "Oh, this GBP has 20 services."

16:41: And when I when I crawl this website, I can see 20 pages and there's a page that

16:49: exact matches every single one of the services that are on the GBP. And we're going to organize these

16:54: because when you're doing the services and categories on the GBP, you organize the services by which category they're

17:00: relevant to. So, you're going to organize it on the website exactly the same as it's organized on the GBP,

17:06: right? Is that clear? I mean, I know that's super confusing if if uh and sorry if I'm not being very clear with it.

17:13: Well, I don't Yeah, it's definitely not going to be 100% clear to everybody. Um

17:19: the only thing is because I think when you when you when you look at it like this

17:24: versus what it looks like on an actual site, right?

17:31: What happened? Oh, I stopped sharing. Oh, okay. So, you want me to add you?

17:37: Okay. So, I'm thinking about it like I'm thinking this graph is how it would look

17:43: like on a site. So, homepage, main categories, a brief description of each one, linking out to a a URL that matches

17:51: that main category, and then sub categories under the main category.

17:57: Yeah. Okay, that makes sense. So, you have homepage, main categories,

18:04: brief description. I'm gonna probably repeat myself because I just want in case nobody heard me. Brief description

18:09: of the main categories that are sitting on the homepage linking out to that.

18:14: Now, do you do you do you now write about that main category on that page

18:20: slashwater heater installation? Yeah, exactly. So you have the little paragraph where you have the link to the

18:25: deeper page and then on that page the target keyword is going to be whatever that category or service is with the

18:32: city name in it. Right? Water heater Houston is going to be my target keyword. So I'm going to write content

18:38: optimized for water heater Houston as if I'm trying to rank organically for that keyword even though I'm not trying to

18:45: rank organically for that keyword. Right? One thing that a lot of people get wrong when I talk to them about uh

18:52: local SEO, uh they'll ask about, oh well, aren't I don't I have to worry about keyword cannibalization or don't I

18:58: have to worry about duplicate content or things like that? And the answer to all of those questions is no, you don't have

19:04: to worry about any of that. Yeah. Right. Because local SEO, we're not trying to rank URLs. Everything that

19:09: we're doing, every URL that we create, uh is done with the goal of ranking the

19:15: GBP higher. Yeah. Right. So, I don't care about duplicate content or cannibalization or anything

19:21: like that because everything is just trying to rank the GBP. Yeah. We're not trying to rank organically essentially.

19:27: Exactly. Right. Now, um and then on that main category page

19:33: after the main description and what they do and blah blah blah 1500 words, then

19:39: we below that we have the subcategories of with that falls under the main category. Correct.

19:45: Yeah. sub. So there's the primary category, there's the secondary categories, and then there's services.

19:52: Yes. And then the services all on that one page. So uh no, so the homepage will have the

19:58: secondary categories and the secondary category pages will have the services.

20:03: So you end up with three layers deep. Three layers deep. Okay, I got it. Got

20:08: it. Okay. Now, um you have the Now when you have the whole site built out like

20:14: this. Okay. Categories, yada yada yada.

20:21: How does the how how does the website now I just I am asking these kind of questions because I know people going to

20:27: have these kind of questions. How does the website translate into ranking a Google Google business profile? It's two

20:33: separate entities, right? So the um the rank algorithm for

20:38: Google maps which as of now mid 2025 has

20:44: not been impacted by AI. The Google map ranking algorithm is pretty much the same now as it was 10 years ago.

20:51: uh that ranking algorithm is based on three core factors, right? Trust

20:57: uh trust, relevance, and proximity, right? So, we obviously can't do

21:03: anything about proximity. That's why we do rank maps when we're doing local SEO. How far away are we? That gets worse and

21:09: worse. Uh the only thing we could do about proximity is potentially hire an unmarked van to move your target

21:15: customers closer to your office location. Probably not ideal. So we don't do anything about proximity. Uh

21:22: trust is Google code for links. Yeah.

21:27: Right. Not internal links. These are links from other external websites, presumably ones that you don't control,

21:34: back to your website. So if if anyone here is super bored, having trouble sleeping tonight, uh feel free to go on

21:41: to Stanford's website. And on Stanford's website, you can find the original PhD

21:47: dissertation by Larry Page where he lays out the foundation of Google's

21:52: algorithm. It's still there. It's public information. Google's algorithm is still highly similar to what he laid out.

21:59: Obviously, it's more complicated now, but it uses the same philosophy. And

22:04: Google is a trillion dollar company because uh Sergey Brin and Larry Page

22:09: had the brilliant uh realization to treat the internet like academic papers.

22:14: Right? So when you write an academic paper, the more other papers site your

22:19: paper, the more important your paper is. So internet because of Google works the

22:25: same way. The more websites, especially trusted websites that link back to your

22:30: website, the more Google will trust your website. Okay, that was the the brilliant realization that made them,

22:37: you know, billionaires, made Google a trillion dollar company. So, trust with Google basically means links. Now,

22:43: yeah, we're talking about local SEO. Uh, the good news is for local SEO, right,

22:49: you're not competing with like Amazon. You're not competing like you did with JP Morgan Chase, right? You're competing

22:56: Joe the plumber. Okay. Now, in Houston, Joe the plumber is probably paying 10

23:02: grand a month or more to rank in the top three, but most places aren't like Houston. And honestly, if you're ranked

23:09: in the top three for plumber Houston, you have a seven figure business. So, if you're paying 10 grand a month for that,

23:14: that's well worth it. Well worth the ROI. Uh anyway, okay. So, when we talk about local SEO, there

23:20: are two kinds of links that we talk about. Okay, we're going to keep this super simple. Uh the first kind of link

23:26: is a low to medium quality link. Nothing crazy, nothing expensive. Uh generally

23:32: uh we use at my agency a PBN. Uh stands for private blog network. It's just a

23:38: low to medium quality link. Uh those go to every URL we create. So we talked

23:43: about the core 30. That's 30 pages. You're going to need 30 PBN links. PBN links aren't super expensive.

23:50: Yeah. So now like that brings me back to the mortgage client because that is what I ended up doing was having

23:56: paying Jason actually that's how I met Jason to build me out a PBN network. So then I

24:04: that's how desperate I was. I was like I don't think I knew where else to get links from and I don't think anybody

24:09: else that I knew knew. And so I was like you know what I'm just going to build my own network. And what a weird

24:15: what a weird way of doing things. It's very weird. Uh, and we had a similar

24:21: realization. We built our own PBN. Uh, it is funny you said PBN network. That's like saying ATM machine. I just have to

24:27: pause and give you a hard time about that. U, but anyway, so these are not high quality links,

24:32: right? They don't need to be. Uh, the reason we need them is because content is

24:39: free for lack of a better word, right? ChatGpt made content free. There are so many tools right now where you can link

24:45: open a open open AI's API with WordPress and publish 10,000 articles at a click

24:51: of a button. So Google doesn't really value just raw content anymore. Not like they did before chat GPT. So these PBN

24:59: links, low to medium quality links, we send them to every single of the 30

25:04: pages, the core 30, just as a signal to Google that they're not AI slop. That's

25:11: it. These are the these are the hey Google this isn't slop type of a link. Uh someone asked won't PBN links get you

25:17: de-indexed. I haven't had that happen. Uh as long as you're using a highquality PBN. Usually if you're not using a high

25:25: quality PBN, uh what happens is Google will figure out that you're using PBN links and de-index the PBN, but it will

25:32: leave your site alone. Uh this makes a lot of sense. PBN links are fairly inexpensive. If using lowquality PBN

25:40: links, which are even cheaper, if those can get a website de-indexed, no one would ever do SEO. They would just buy a

25:46: bunch of crappy PBN links to all of their competitors and then they're number one because all their competitors got de-indexed. So, it's generally

25:53: pretty hard to get de-indexed just with crappy links because Yeah, SEO is harder than getting crappy links. That's a lot

26:00: easier. Yeah. So, when people say that PBN links uh if they get found out, you get penalized.

26:06: What often is going on is the PBN links get bound out. Uh the PBN gets

26:11: de-indexed and then suddenly the website that was getting all that link power is getting nothing. So it loses rankings

26:18: but it basically goes to where it would have been if you didn't have any PBNs, right? Am I making sense with that? So

26:24: the PBNs don't actually hurt you. They just stop helping you which hurts you.

26:29: Yeah. Yeah. If you're taking three steps forward, you might be taking two steps back. Yeah. But we're not using any of these PBN

26:36: links to actually rank anything, right? That's not our goal. That's not why we're doing them. These are just a signal to Google, not AI, right? We

26:43: Google's AI, uh, chat GPT, none of the AI things care even a little bit about

26:48: links. So, all this talk about PBN links is just for Google's base algorithm, just for local rankings, right?

26:55: Hopefully, no one here is trying to do non-local rankings. If you are, good luck. Uh, so we're talking about local

27:01: rankings. Okay. Okay, so that's one type of link. That's the this is not AI slop Google link. The second type of link

27:08: which is much more important. This is the link that will actually build trust. Okay, and this is the link these trust

27:15: building links uh you guys have probably heard of them if you're in the local SEO space. The number one that we almost

27:21: always recognize is join the local chamber of commerce. A massive signal of trust. Beyond that, it's going to be

27:28: things like sponsoring local sports leagues, uh sponsoring local charities, sponsoring local charitable events, u

27:35: anything along those lines is, uh going to often come with a link. Make sure it comes with a link before you do the

27:41: sponsorships. Um but a lot of that is going to come with a link. And those are

27:46: incredibly powerful links. Uh we have clients where they're in fairly competitive spaces and we spent like

27:53: $500 sponsoring local events and they're ranked in the top three within two or

27:59: three weeks. Okay, these are incredibly incredibly powerful links and I used to have so we

28:07: used to use the that type of link even before AI came out and I used to have an

28:12: employee whose almost full-time job hey we just got a client in Fort Wayne

28:18: Indiana find me local charities and local sports leagues who are looking for sponsorships who will give me a link and

28:25: you know she would just go on the internet and try to find it. Well, chat GPT can do that for us now. Um, which is

28:33: pretty cool. Can I should I can I show a prompt that we use for that? Yeah. Is that too much?

28:39: No. No, it's not too much. No, just let me know when you share it

28:45: so I can click it. Perfect. Okay. So, I

28:51: click click click. So, obviously this is in the school group. Uh, so, uh, it's sharing now.

28:59: Hold on a second. I'm trying to remove myself. Wait a minute. There we go.

29:05: Perfect. Okay. So, uh if you don't want to join the group, that's fine. Uh you can I don't know. Freeze frame AI can

29:12: probably grab this text. Use the prompt. Uh it's a good prompt. We use it all the time. Um uh let me go down scroll down

29:18: so you can see the whole prompt. It's quite long. Uh so uh I say to use it with uh claude deep research which if

29:24: you're using claude then if you take this button it will uh do deep research. Um I can show you what it what what the

29:31: output looks like here. So we can copy the whole thing paste it here and then we're going to change to Fort Wayne.

29:39: Actually you know what make it mine. Do do Wayne. Wayne New Jersey.

29:45: Yeah. And in what business? Electrician. electrician. So, this will take a few

29:51: moments to run. I'm going to turn it to opus. Um, opus sonnet is the one that we use for writing content. Opus is a

29:57: little bit better for bigger tasks like this. So, we'll hit run. That'll go in the background. Um, I'll share again

30:03: when when Now, I know I know you're a a Claude lover. Now, what about with the release

30:08: of chat GPT5? Like, I know you probably just like I'm not changing. I'm just sticking with what I know.

30:13: No, no, we tried it. We tried chat GPT5. And look, it's better than what chat GPT4 and a half did, but the content

30:20: that comes out of claude, I still think is better than chat GPT5. Uh, that being said, we still use chatgp, if I could

30:28: speak, chat GPT5 for a variety of other topics. Uh, but for just straight up

30:35: content writing, Claude is our go-to. And the reason I'm running this in Claude and not ChatgPT, uh, I will say

30:42: that if you run this prompt in chat GPT with the deep research, you're going to get more options. It's going to be more

30:48: thorough, but it's going to take like 15 or 20 minutes to run. Claude will run this in probably 5 minutes. So, it's

30:55: still going to take a minute. Um, but this is incredibly powerful. Uh, I I

31:00: love this. It saves so much time of our team. Uh we can just basically run this,

31:06: join a couple of sponsorship events uh because the prompt is going to make sure I mean double check, right? AI tends to

31:12: lie all the time. Uh so double check, but theoretically the prompt is only going to give you opportunities that

31:18: will give you a link in exchange for a sponsorship. So yeah, I think I mentioned James to you at one point. We

31:24: had a personal injury attorney out of New Orleans and they were like sixth, seventh average rank position and he

31:31: wasn't a New Orleans chamber member. So, he joined the New Orleans Chamber. Uh we sponsored uh his daughter actually

31:38: played softball, so he sponsored her 9-year-old softball team. Uh got his uh

31:44: firm name on the softball t-shirts. Uh and then uh he sponsored the Bayou Bash

31:50: which is event in New Orleans. And uh he went from like five or six average rank

31:55: to two. Yeah. I mean, and that's such an easy thing to do. You should be doing it anyway. You know what I mean? If you're if you're a if if you're a

32:02: local if you want to drum up business locally, like that's like the easiest thing to do. Like even like Wayne Pal

32:09: um you know, they have a bunch of leagues. I always sponsor it. Um a buddy

32:14: of mine that has a sporting goods store sponsors it and yeah, you get automatic links. I I never even got a link because

32:22: I never sent links to my website. But should I stop sharing right now? I think the stream is just showing Claude Clank

32:29: turning around in the background. Okay, hold on.

32:36: I'm still trying to figure out how to use this damn thing. Why is it not showing

32:41: like is it just sharing a black screen right now? No, no, it's sharing both. It's showing sharing both of us. Oh, there we go.

32:47: Okay. So, that's running. So, so you use that instead of having somebody you just get

32:53: a list and then have then your employee just reaches out. Yeah. And some of the lists like

32:58: literally, you know, you you you go to it and it's like a PayPal button and you just click the button, you give them

33:04: money and then the link shows up like so easy. Yeah. Um Yeah, it's great. So, so those are

33:11: the two types of links. So, okay, back to what I was talking about. I mentioned proximity. we can't do anything about

33:16: trust. This is basically how we build trust um by sponsoring these local events and everything. Uh the other

33:22: link, the PBN links, that's just, you know, hey Google, this isn't slop. The great thing about these local event

33:28: sponsorships, remember I said that AIS don't care at all about links. They they work based on something that we call

33:34: mentions, right? So, they're looking for brand mentions. And the more trusted the

33:40: more and the more trusted the brand mentions, the more likely they are to recommend you. Um, so this type of

33:46: mention is also very good to get chat GPT to to to recommend you. Um, there's

33:52: also like we call them like super citations because the problem in the SEO world if you say citations, everyone

33:58: thinks of those like 2019 style citations where you'd hire VAS to type

34:04: your business name in little boxes until their fingers bled. Those don't do anything. Google doesn't care about

34:10: those. ChatGpt doesn't care about those. Nobody cares about those. Please don't do those. If you're doing those, you're

34:15: wasting your money. Um, but super citations like Bing for Business, Apple Maps, uh, Yelp, Forsquare, Instagram,

34:23: uh, those types of things are also very valuable to chat GPT, especially

34:28: especially Bing for Business. Okay, if you're trying to get ChatGpt to recommend your business, you need to

34:34: have a Bing for business profile. Microsoft is a huge funer of Open AI and

34:40: ChatGpt works on Bing's index, not on Google's. Got it. which then segus you eventually

34:47: into ranking and and recombt recommend you and all that stuff.

34:53: Yeah, exactly. So those are the two things. The third one is relevance. Um so when we talk about relevance, we

34:59: break it into two subcategories. We have topical relevance and we have geographical relevance. Now for 99% of

35:06: businesses, you're going to build the topical relevance you need by with the core 30 that we've already talked about.

35:12: um that's going to be sufficient topical relevance unless you're trying to rank in like New York City or Houston or

35:18: something like that. 99% of businesses that's all you need for topical relevance. Um then we talk about the

35:24: geographical relevance and to get the geographical relevance we basically have to build well geographical content and I

35:32: can show an example of that but our prompt finished. Should I share and and

35:39: show you what it came up with? Yep. Here we go. Wayne, New Jersey electrician.

35:46: All right. So, it's saying there are exceptional opportunities, James, for for your town.

35:53: Um, so of course it's recommending the Wayne Chamber of Commerce. Excellent. Uh, and hey, the Wayne Day, the town's

36:01: premier annual event, that's accepting sponsorships. Have you do you know what that event is? Wayne Day.

36:06: Yes. All right. So, you can sponsor that. Uh you can also uh do something through the local universities, the government and

36:13: here we go uh minimal investment uh join the chamber of commerce uh tap into

36:19: Wayne local media opportunity with publisher actively seeking local business content and explicitly

36:24: providing backlinks in the articles then we have a link so that you can reach out to this person uh talk to them about

36:30: that uh we can keep coming down uh here's a link to that university uh JC

36:36: promotions uh provides confirmed backlinks to the local sponsorship. 750

36:42: bucks per event. And then we got some links there. So we can give them $750 and get that event. Then we have So

36:47: anyway, this just keeps going and going going. Um yeah, so this is what this prompt

36:54: outputs. It's just basically, look at this. Wayne Public Library community programs and business resource directory

36:59: listings. Yep. Right. That's free, right? Right. You can go to the Wayne public library, create your business directory, and I

37:06: mean the Wayne public library is uh probably a fairly high trust domain

37:13: because it's a public library. So, it's probably on a.gov domain or something like that. So, yeah. Um this is why we

37:19: love this prompt. That's great. That's awesome. It's giving me a bunch of ideas. Oh, someone had a good question. Should

37:24: the Chamber of Commerce and sponsorship links go to the client's business homepage? So the way that I would phrase it, those should go to the GBP landing

37:32: page, uh, which usually is your homepage, but if you have a multilocation business, then you might

37:37: be joining multiple chambers of commerce. Each one should go to the relevant landing page for that business.

37:44: Now, local chamber of commerce is can be stretched. the New Orleans personal

37:50: injury attorney. We joined every chamber of commerce within

37:56: 70 miles. Hold on. You you're you're breaking up. Hold on one second. You're

38:02: breaking up.

38:08: Give it a second to catch up to you. Okay. I think you're good. Yeah. You So, I was

38:13: going to actually ask you about that. You broke up with a lot of things you said up until you said my personal

38:19: injury attorney. You joined X number of uh Chamber of Commerce is how many?

38:28: Yeah. Uh 13 or 14. Yeah. So all within how many miles?

38:33: 70. Yeah. So I was going to ask you like if I'm if I'm an electrician in Wayne, but

38:39: I also serve like 15 towns around me. Does it matter where it comes from?

38:47: So, I'm not going to say that you're likely to more likely to rank in the town that you that the chamber is that

38:54: you got the link from. Right. So, for example, one of the chambers that we got the link from is like in Mobile,

38:59: Alabama, right? Yeah. He doesn't rank in Mobile, Alabama, and he's not going to. It's very, very

39:05: hard to rank in a city different than the city your GBP is in. So, it's really

39:11: just to get the authority link from a reasonably relevant local chamber.

39:17: Got it. Somebody asked um the the three cores, trust, proximity, and relevance.

39:23: Yes. Uh with trust being links, uh relevance being the content you're producing, and

39:29: then proximity is how far away the searcher is. Yeah. Yeah. And then, um the marketing show,

39:34: actually, I think that's James Hurst. I think that's James. What's up, James? Uh how much total would you spend on all these links?

39:40: Good qu. So it depends on the client's budget, right? So PI attorney in New Orleans, right? New Orleans is a fairly

39:46: large city. Uh not huge, but it's like 6700,000 something like that. And

39:51: typically PI attorney is one of the most uh competitive spaces for local SEO. So,

39:57: if you have an attorney in a city as large as New Orleans, uh, for PI, trying to rank for personal injury attorney in

40:03: New Orleans, they should at least be paying you5 to $7,000 a month to make that happen. So, if I'm going to join a

40:10: dozen chambers of commerce, each one is like two or three hundred bucks. That's $3,000. That's half of what he's paying

40:17: me for one month. Yeah. Yeah. It's a no-brainer. Now, obviously,

40:22: if I if I'm trying to rank for plumber eclectic in Eclectic, Alabama, I don't

40:27: need to join 12 chambers of commerce to rank in Eclectic Alabama.

40:32: Yeah. I don't need to do anything except create a GBP and to rank in Eclectic Alabama. That I think 8,000 people live

40:38: there with you got to have the core 30 though. Not if you're ranking, right? If you're ranking, you're done. But yeah,

40:46: nobody's on that would be like, "Hey, watch me rank for snow removal Miami.

40:51: See how easy local SEO is?" That's funny. Yeah.

40:57: Yeah, that's funny. So, you got core 30 starts with the site. You got the the

41:02: core three, which is relevance, proximity, and uh trust.

41:09: What else you got going on? What about name, address, and phone number? So, that's where we talked briefly. I

41:15: mentioned citations. Um, and that's where we're going to want to get those like very high quality citations. Uh,

41:24: uh, let me pull up the list real quick here. So, you're not using um, Bright Local to

41:29: get citations. No, Bright Local is pretty expensive. Um, and Yex is more reasonably priced,

41:38: but the problem with Yex is they delete your listings or they delete your

41:44: citations if you cancel. Uh, because you pay monthly for it. Yeah. Yeah. Which is kind of crappy. Um,

41:52: so you could get them all manually. All of these platforms, you can go and get them manually. Um, but they all almost

41:58: all of them require some form of verification. So they're kind of a pain to get manually. Um, so the tool that we

42:05: use to get them. Can I show the tool? Is that too much? No, go ahead and show it.

42:10: All right, I'll show the tool. Um, I'm trying to figure out if I can,

42:21: and I will say while he's pulling that up, like, you know, obviously,

42:26: you know, there's training that goes along with with this. I'll drop the link at the end. Caleb has a whole school

42:31: training that literally step by step walks you all the way through this. I mean, it's a it's literally a no-brainer. Um, and one of the reasons

42:38: why I wanted to do this because on my own channel, I get a lot of people, you know, asking me about SEO and stuff like

42:43: that, and I wanted to have a resource for them instead of, you know, you know, what they say in the in business general

42:51: is like the person who chases two rabbits catches none. And so, I'm really good in some things and SEO is not one

42:57: of them. So, I just pull everything off to Caleb for that, whether it even be clients or um

43:04: people that want to learn it. Yeah.

43:09: And yeah, uh I I ask you stuff all the time. There's like I have a lot of clients who will ask like, "Hey, do you

43:15: do Facebook ads?" And the answer will be, "No, we don't do Facebook ads." Uh

43:21: but I know someone who does. Um, okay. So, this is the tool. Uh, tool's called

43:27: Lead Snap. Um, and basically, uh, it has API connections to 51 different listings

43:34: and it's Apple Maps, Bing, Google Assistant, Siri, Alexa, blah blah blah, like all highquality citations and uh,

43:41: you turn it on with one click and then it syncs to all of these different places and like so like with Bing,

43:48: right? To normally get a Bing, you need to go through verification, you need to get a postcard. Same thing with Apple

43:54: Maps verifications and all of that jazz. Uh, this just links it up and it creates an exact copy of your GBP. It takes like

44:01: four minutes. Um, so this is basically what does all of our citations. It's $20

44:07: a month. Um, I know the owner I know you know the owner too. Hopefully he won't be too

44:13: annoyed if I say it's $20 a month, but if um if you cancel it, the tool does

44:18: not delete the citations. It doesn't delete it like some other tools do. So take with that what you mean or take

44:24: with that what you will. Yeah. Yeah. Least Knob I remember he when he created that he spent like years

44:30: building that thing. Oh he's he's into this tool for Yeah. Yeah. He spent years. It does a lot of

44:36: other stuff too and we use it for a lot of other stuff but the citation functionality is what got me really

44:42: pumped about it because not only does that help you rank on Google, it also helps you get recommended by chat GPT

44:47: and by Google's AI overview. Yeah. And so, do you want to segue into

44:53: into kind of that and give a couple tidbits on that before we go too long and people need to rewatch the replay?

45:00: Sure. So, we are there any good questions? Let's see. Six toad feet. That's a fun name. Do you pay for the

45:06: Chamber of Commerce membership out of the monthly fee or do you ask the client to pay? Generally, I pay for it out of the monthly fee. Right. Uh if we're

45:12: doing SEO for a client, it's um so there there's this funny thing that people hate being nickeled and dyed, right? Um,

45:20: so you've been in New York City, James. Yep. You've taken a I was just there yesterday at a go high

45:26: level event. You've taken a New York City taxi cab. Not an Uber, but like the old school taxi cab.

45:31: Yeah, I have. Yeah. So, if you were to design the worst possible pricing system for human

45:40: psychologically, it would be the pricing system for New York City taxi cabs. Yeah. Time and uh mileage. like it

45:47: and it just sits there and goes up 10 cents, 10 cents, 10 and it's infuriating to sit there and

45:53: watch it tick up slowly over time. People hate that. So, we don't nickel and dime our SEO clients. Uh we say,

46:00: "Hey, here's the price for a fully managed campaign and then we take care of everything." Uh chamber memberships,

46:07: uh they're usually based on the business size. Uh, and you know, if you're the

46:12: one joining, I don't know, maybe you can use your business, but then put their business name and their link in there if

46:17: they happen to have a giant business, you know, whatever. You can figure that out. But most of the time, the chamber memberships are a few hundred bucks a

46:24: year. Uh, so I just pay for that out of their monthly. Um, okay. Geographical relevance pages.

46:31: So, that's a good question. Should we talk about geographical relevance or do you want to talk about chat? Let's do Let's do that. That's like what service pages and stuff. No,

46:39: the service pages are for topical relevance. So, let me pull up

46:45: a rank map and I will share my screen. Go ahead.

46:52: [Music] [Laughter] I'll just wait so I can click it. All right, we're good.

46:58: So, this is not a client of mine. This is just some random plumber in Fort Wayne, Indiana.

47:03: U if if you guys ever watch my YouTube channels, I talk about Fort Wayne, Indiana a lot. Uh, I've never actually

47:09: been there. I don't know anyone who lives there, but Fort Wayne, Indiana just seems like a perfectly generic

47:14: Midwestern town. Uh, if you're from there and that's really insulting to you, then I apologize. Okay, that's why

47:21: Fort Wayne, Indiana. So, this is the heat map for Stanton Plumbing, uh, the local rink map. Uh, so the way this

47:27: works, obviously, if you were standing right here and you searched for the target keyword, which is plumber Fort

47:32: Wayne, if you're standing right here, Stanton Plumbing would be in the number two position. And then each one of these

47:38: dots is one mile away. So one mile away from Stanton Plumbing's address, they're

47:44: in the fifth position. If you're not in the top three, you're basically invisible. Uh so this rank map is pretty

47:50: bad, right? So if I looked at rank map rank map like this, then I know we don't

47:55: need to talk about geographical relevance because they don't have enough topical relevance yet. Okay? You need to

48:01: have a decent amount of topical relevance before geographical relevance starts to become important. So, what I

48:06: just did, uh, when you run the heat, when you run this local rank map with

48:11: lead snap, you can actually pull up all of the competitors and you can pull up every single one of the rank maps that

48:17: you want to. So, it's pretty cool. Uh, and what's also great is it's going to sort average rank, but what I like is

48:23: sorting by the top 3%. So, this is the percent of the rank map that this business is in the top three. Okay? And

48:29: that's great because again, right, top three means that you can be seen. So a rank map that looks like this, you know,

48:36: 20 to 30 to 40% in the top three. Uh this is a rank map that shows it's time

48:42: to start thinking about geographical relevance instead of topical relevance. Okay. So the way we do

48:48: hold on. So in my again in my simple brain like I feel like this rotor router

48:54: which is a huge company but Rotorooer plumbing would be located closer to

48:59: Hunter Hunter Town rather than Arlington Park. I would agree that yeah uh Fort

49:06: Wayne I think is in the middle of this map. Yeah. Uh but yeah they're clearly going to be located up here. Uh because remember I

49:13: ran it centered on Stanton Plumbing not Rotorooer. Yep. Yep. So, I'm just using this as an

49:19: example for how how to think about geographical relevance. Got it. Okay. So, the way that we we do

49:25: geographical relevance is we're going to focus on fours and fives, right? If we

49:30: took like this 10 and did a whole bunch of work to turn this 10 into a four, we

49:36: might feel really good about ourselves, but the plumber is not going to get any more calls, right? Four is invisible.

49:42: Moving from 20 to four doesn't mean anything. If you don't move into the top three, you're wasting your time. Y So,

49:48: I'm gonna move from four to three or from five to three. That's what I'm focused on. So, I'm gonna look at these fours, fives, uh, and I'm gonna focus on

49:55: that. And what we're going to do, I'm going to zoom in, and you can see, uh, this is a good example. So, this number

50:02: five is right next to a neighborhood that Google is calling conquered hills.

50:07: So, that's great. And it's also very close to Sunny Brook Acres. So, I might do both of those. So what I would do is

50:13: I would write an article uh for this website. Target keyword is plumber Fort Wayne. So I'll write an article uh and

50:20: the target keyword for that article is going to be plumber conquered hills Fort Wayne. And then I'll write another

50:26: article about plumber sunnybrook acres Fort Wayne. And those articles are going to talk

50:33: about how the plumber does jobs in that area, how they do projects in that area. Maybe show some before and after photos.

50:39: they can be AI generated of what projects look like in that area. Then we're going to provide driving

50:44: directions from Sunny Brook acres back to the GBP address and in the other one

50:49: we'll provide it from Conquer Hills back to the GBP address. We'll write another one on Brooks Brookside Estates. We'll

50:55: write it on Elorado Hills. All these different neighborhoods are going to write geographical content to target

51:00: that neighborhood that Google is recognizing because this is Google Maps uh for the keyword plumber Fort Wayne.

51:06: Am I making sense? Is that Yeah. I mean, I can't imagine how many articles you're going to need to have to

51:12: hit every town. So, one of our big clients is a LASIC eye surgeon in the city of Chicago. And

51:20: um let me see if I can pull up a rank map that doesn't have the business name on

51:26: it. Or you could maybe or take a screenshot of it.

51:35: I mean, let me Right. So, what we did,

51:43: I'm just going to delete a bunch of stuff here real quick. How do I get rid of this stupid? Here we go. Ah,

51:48: excellent. Okay, so let me share the before and after.

51:56: Oh, I caught it. The business name is in the uh file. So, I'm going to do a quick

52:02: save as. [Laughter] Yeah, you people on on YouTube, you go

52:08: and mess with businesses. So, I just I can't I can't let you do that. Do they with client? Oh, all the time.

52:15: It's rid Okay, here we go. Now, I'm going to share screen window example. There you go. Okay. Um, so this is uh

52:22: Lasic Guy Sergey Chicago. This is when they hired us. Um, and this is where they are now. And it doesn't So, one

52:29: thing to keep in mind, this rank map is actually much much larger, right? So Montro's beach is up here and Montro's

52:35: beach is up here. So we actually made the rank map larger because they were ranking so well. So what we did uh when

52:43: they hired us were great. All the topical relevance in the world,

52:48: they're just missing geographical relevance. So we started producing just crazy of content for all of these

52:55: different neighborhoods around Chicago. Okay, this took us about six months. Do you know how many pieces of content

53:01: based on each one of these little dots we produced in that amount of time? How many? There's 170 pieces of content.

53:08: I was going to say 200. Okay. Yeah. 170 pieces of content focused on these little neighborhoods

53:14: around Chicago to turn these individual little dots uh green. And it worked.

53:20: So my question to you is this. You're using AI to generate the content.

53:25: Yeah. So let me show you. of course. Uh so this is the school

53:31: group again I'm sharing again and let me go uh this is the the pro group where everything is like uh step by step over

53:38: the shoulder. Um so it's under AI content prioritization. Perfect. So what

53:45: we would do uh like I can hit share and I can uh download this CSV which will

53:50: give me all the data and then this is right uh I can come into here

53:58: and run this prompt uh you know give it the target keyword

54:04: scan and this is the data that's in the CSV and what this prompt will do is it's going to analyze the data and it's

54:10: amazing right because AI with the latitude and longitude it knows the neighborhood names. So, it's going to analyze the data,

54:16: basically give you a prioritized list of content based on where it sees fours and fives, neighborhood names, and the

54:24: demographics of those neighborhoods. Uh, so you run this prompt with the CSV

54:29: of the rank data, and then bam, you know exactly what your content plans are for the next few months. Uh, and then every

54:36: month this heat map reruns and you grab the data, feed it to AI and create that

54:43: content for that month. And now are you are you creating like

54:49: So there was 170 towns right around neighborhoods. Neighborhoods. Okay. 170 neighborhoods.

54:57: And why not just create all 170 at once? Cost.

55:03: Cost. No. What's costing you money? So we so so we have AI write the

55:09: content, but we have humans edit it, right? We're never going to have AI output content and then just post it. So

55:15: we always have humans edit the content. Uh we always check the content with uh this tool, zero GPT, uh just to make

55:21: sure it's not scoring like 99% uh AI written. Those tools are all crap

55:26: and they don't work, but we still check it anyway. Uh then we have a developer

55:32: who creates the page, puts it on there. The pages they can't be walls of text, right? Google won't index. They Google

55:38: won't pay attention to walls of text. So we need images, we need the alt text, we need the file names, we need callouts.

55:44: So there's some development time to do all that. Um then we have to add internal links back to that content. So

55:49: we need to go into other pages.

55:58: You froze again, by the way. I don't know if you could hear me.

56:07: I think I lost you. We add a PBN link. Oh. Oh, boy. What's wrong with my

56:13: internet connection? Can you hear me at all? Yeah, I we missed about 30 seconds, 25 seconds.

56:19: Well, I was just describing why we can't just do all of them in month one. There's just It's not like cranking out

56:25: a bunch of crappy content and posting it. There's a a bit more involved, but it's not overwhelming. Right

56:31: now, where are those link? Like where are those pages? Are they are they like listed somewhere like or

56:38: Yeah. So on the navbar, we'll have a little box that says like locations and

56:43: then you click on that and it's going to describe uh the main city and then it's

56:48: going to say like we've service customers in these neighborhoods and then it's just a list of all the links

56:54: to all the location. Oh, okay. That's easy enough. Got it. Okay. And um

56:59: and so like what like what that's a lot of work, but what are you charging that lasic company?

57:07: Right. So for the clients that we run uh our pricing is very simple. It's

57:12: scope-based pricing. Uh we charge uh $300 per article that's published. And

57:19: that's basically all in everything is included that you know we'll also do the citations. uh we're going to do the

57:26: powerful link building stuff like that. So, you know, if a client comes to us and we say, "Okay, looks like you're

57:31: going to need 20 new articles a month," then we're going to say our price is $6,000 a month.

57:38: Got it. And so if they So that 17 so you when you know you have to do 200, right?

57:44: because you've did the front like the front end work um to know that they needed 200, let's say 200. Are you

57:51: capping it at TW at 20 a month or you saying like I need to spread this out over

57:56: like what's the most you'll do in a month? Right. We'll do as many as they have a budget for. Right. So, got it.

58:03: Uh if they need 200, then that's a $60,000 engagement. So, if we say, "Hey,

58:08: uh, we'll do this next month for $60,000, and as long as they pay the invoice, we'll we'll get it cranked

58:13: out." Most of the time, we're going to spread it out over, you know, 6 to9 months. Got it. And then after that's done, what

58:20: what happens? Any ongoing SEO? So, after that's done, we basically just watch that local rank map and anytime we

58:27: see something turn from top three to below the top three, like, okay, another piece of geographic relevance we need

58:33: right there. So every every month we're still checking on them and making sure that everything is still green. Uh and

58:40: if you know if everything is green then maybe we don't publish any content because we don't need anything that month

58:45: and then there's no cost. Then there's no cost, right? Got it. So you're actually doing it

58:50: artic almost like an article based like you know. Yeah. And I will say that uh so my I I I

58:58: I think that I pay my employees well. They're all fully remote. Um, and I pay

59:04: like $45 an hour. Uh, so my cost all in to do the articles

59:10: is less than $100. And that's everyone's time. Uh, that's the link sourcing,

59:16: that's everything involved. So now I've just given what my profit margin is. Uh, but a lot of that profit margin of

59:21: course goes to managing the client. Uh, goes to like joining the chambers and all of this other stuff. Uh, but my

59:28: point, the reason I said that my cost to do it, like, yeah, 300 a piece sounds expensive, but when you realize that I'm

59:34: paying 45 bucks an hour, each one of these articles is one or two hours of work, right? And that's including the

59:40: development time. Uh, you can find a developer on Upwork for 10 bucks an hour and get that. So, if you're a local

59:47: business owner doing this yourself, you can crank the core 30 out in a couple of

59:52: days. Yeah. So now if I'm thinking about it from a

59:58: from a simple perspective, not a lasic eye surgeon or a plastic surgeon or a PI

1:00:03: lawyer, but if I'm thinking about it for like bluecollar, like you know, home improvement, you know, contractor,

1:00:10: uh kitchen replacement, things like that, which is could be a contractor. Um

1:00:17: maybe actually maybe that's that's high-end, too. So what about like electrician, plumber?

1:00:23: Um, you know, tow truck. I forget tow trucks. Tow truck.

1:00:28: But like, but like blueco collar like would it be crazy to think that you can

1:00:34: tr like I back in the day like I would charge like crazy amounts of money for SEO just because they clients have

1:00:39: literally no idea what it would or should or could cost, right? Um, and so

1:00:45: like I'm just trying to think of like do you have any ongoing SEO clients that you just have forever that are just

1:00:50: always paying you a flat fee or is it basically work-based fee? No. Uh, a lot of them are just ongoing

1:00:58: forever, right? So, in my experience, an SEO client that's been with you for 6

1:01:03: months is likely to stay with you for years. Yeah. So, multiple SEO clients that have

1:01:09: been with me for years, but you're still charging them even though you're not doing any work or you're always doing some sort of work.

1:01:15: So, I mean, we're watching the rank maps, right? And if the rank map is all green, then we don't do anything that

1:01:20: month, but we're always like it's it's we're not going to go like six months without doing anything because we're

1:01:27: going to have some of them tick from green to orange or something, right? Yeah. Yeah. And what we're charging is very

1:01:33: justified by the ranking, right? So, hey, if I'm charging a PI attorney

1:01:40: $10,000 a month, each case they get is worth 30 grand. Yeah. At least. So, in the top three and they get a

1:01:47: handful of cases a month, man, they're thrilled with the $10,000 bill. Um, and

1:01:53: I did a ton of work in the front to get them ranked and now we can just sort of ride back, do what needs to do to keep

1:01:59: them there, which is obviously less. Yeah. Yeah. But they're still getting the same amount of value. They're still getting

1:02:05: the same amount of calls, the same amount of cases, uh, that they were getting, you know, on the months where

1:02:12: we had to bust our ass to get them ranked. Sure. It's one of the SEO agencies typically do pricing. In my experience, a lot of

1:02:19: agencies on the first few months of the contract will make a very tight profit

1:02:24: margin, but once they're ranked, the profit margin grows quite a bit. It's another reason that I think a lot of

1:02:30: local business owners should be, especially with AI, managing a lot of their SEO themselves.

1:02:37: Well, that's a lot to ask. I mean, with AI, it's definitely doable.

1:02:42: And if it's not doable, then hopefully on the on uh you're watching the live stream, you know, you're getting some

1:02:48: inspiration. You can just do this for local businesses. Like, it's it's not rocket science, right? We're just

1:02:53: building the right relevance, the right trust, and using AI to find those sources to write the content.

1:02:59: Yeah, I I think you're very wrong about businesses doing this. There's zero chance of a business doing this.

1:03:05: Yeah, you're probably right because I I' I've been on the phone with business owners and I've told them like, "Here's my cost structure. Here's my pricing.

1:03:12: Here's what we're going to do." And they'll say like, "All right, let's move forward." Yeah. I was like,

1:03:18: "Yeah, I mean I I'll be honest with you. I've been doing this a long time and I I like I still would need and and you gave me

1:03:23: access to your training like because I'm working on my electrician like you know and I've spent

1:03:30: hours working on it and like I had to keep going back to the core 30 and like okay I got to do this I do there's no

1:03:36: way this guy's an electrician bro he's hanging lights and installing like you know working in industrial buildings

1:03:42: like he's not going to sit there at night at nine o'clock at night with two kids and and work on his SEO. Yeah,

1:03:48: you're probably right. Probably right. I know I'm right. So, like again, it

1:03:55: just makes, you know, we get like the sky is falling vibes of AI and it's

1:04:00: going to take, you know, marketing agencies are dead, which drives me effing crazy. It's like, yo, no, it's

1:04:06: just that you can do a much better job faster and probably can charge more now.

1:04:12: Like, you can achieve more faster and better than ever before. I mean, think of back in the day. Like it was I feel

1:04:19: like it's easier now than it was then. Yeah, I agree. I mean, I agree. I agree.

1:04:24: And what's so so many people are saying like, "Oh, Google is dead. Everyone is on chat GPT." Uh what's what's

1:04:30: fascinating about that, my counterpoint to that uh which is databacked is search volume on Google is going up.

1:04:37: Yes. Right. So what what seems to be happening almost certainly is that

1:04:42: people are asking chat GPT for recommendations and then they're repeating that same search on Google and

1:04:47: we have known for many many years that if you're ranked well on Google that is a massive vote of trust right the the

1:04:54: searcher the person searching on Google if you're showing up number one number two they just trust you more because

1:05:00: Google said you were good now if you have Google recommending you and you have chat GPT recommending you uh your

1:05:09: close rate as a business owner can go up. It the calls become easy, right? Uh

1:05:14: I've I've listened to calls of clients of mine who are recommended in both places. The person calls and just says,

1:05:19: "Hey, when can you come here?" Oh, that's what the prices. Okay, sounds good. Uh because that GPT said they're

1:05:25: the best and they're ranked number one on Google, right? And the great thing is as long as you're doing uh chat GPT is

1:05:32: usually easier to get recommended than Google because we don't have to worry about links the same. Um but with chat

1:05:38: GPT there are a couple of things that you have to do that you don't have to do to get uh to get ranked on Google. So

1:05:43: it's a little bit different but it's easier to get the chat GPT wreck because no one knows how to do it right.

1:05:49: Yeah. So I guess you know share a little bit like you know like you did with like you know relevance proximity like is there is

1:05:56: there do you have a core something when it comes to ranking in in so we have a core eight no um so chat

1:06:05: GPT uh so the first thing to keep in mind I said this before right chat GPT uses Bing's index got it

1:06:11: okay so you have to have a Bing for business uh okay you have to have a Bing for business I have seen so many

1:06:18: businesses ranked number one on Google and they're like they don't have a Bing

1:06:25: for business listing and chat GPT thinks they don't exist. Okay, so being for business listing that's the most

1:06:30: important thing to rank on chat GPT. Uh number two, uh I briefly mentioned this. It's we refer to it as mentions. Um

1:06:38: those are actually easier to get most of the time when you're getting a link for Google that's going to have a mention

1:06:44: associated with it also. And there are a lot of mentions you're going to get without a link. And that does nothing

1:06:50: for Google. Chat GPT loves it because chat GPT loves the mentions. So the biggest thing, right, two big things

1:06:58: that I'll say two big things for chat GPT that are different. Number one is citation consistency. Okay, so I've

1:07:04: talked about how um chat GPT looks at mentions. Citation consistency used to

1:07:10: be super important with Google. It stopped being important with Google probably five, four or five years ago or

1:07:15: in the early 2020s. We stopped caring about citation consistency. Now we care

1:07:20: about it a lot again because if you think about it from chat GPT, right? If you have a business that's ABC plumbing

1:07:26: and then you have your Apple Maps listing is A.B.C.P.

1:07:31: plumbing. Uh and then your Bing for business listing is ABC Plumbing and Air. ChatGpt doesn't know those are the

1:07:39: same business because chat GPT doesn't follow links. ChatGpt doesn't crawl links like Google does.

1:07:44: Yeah. Okay. Make sense? Am I making sense with that? Yes. So chat so citation consistency is like

1:07:52: so important for chat GPT not important for Google at all. So that's that's a big one. And the second one um because

1:07:59: remember like all of this is based on chat GPT is bad at crawling the internet. Uh so structured data also

1:08:07: called schema very important for chat GPT it's been important for Google but it's more

1:08:13: important for chat GPT if you don't know what that is structured data the way I like to think about it is uh pretend

1:08:20: you're moving right you're moving into a new house and you pack all of your worldly belongings into boxes uh

1:08:28: structured data is the label on the boxes right when you get to your new

1:08:33: house, you could open the box and ruffle through it and figure out what everything is, but it's a lot easier if

1:08:39: there's a label on the box and you know what room it goes in, right? So, the structured data tells chat GPT exactly

1:08:46: what's on that page and what chat GPT should care about on that page. So, let me give an example of how critical this

1:08:53: is for chat GPT. The PI attorney I mentioned, right, they had a major settlement. Uh, it was a pretty sad

1:09:00: story, so I won't go into it, but it was a big settlement. It was like $3 million, right? Woot woot for them. Uh,

1:09:06: found them with SEO. So, yeah, my monthly fee sounds pretty good when they get a $3 million settlement, right? The

1:09:11: attorney takes a third. Um, the literally the attorney bought a a Bentley after that settlement came

1:09:18: through. Anyway, okay. Jesus Christ. So, they got they get this settlement and then they want uh ChatGpt to mention

1:09:25: this settlement when people are asking for an attorney in that town, right? Uh so chat GBT is is recommending them but

1:09:32: doesn't talk about the settlement. So uh they have local business schema. If there's a hundred tools that can

1:09:38: generate local business schema so you know go find one that it'll generate it. ChatGpt does a great job generating it

1:09:44: also. Uh so what we did we took the local business schema from their website. We gave it to ChatGpt and then

1:09:50: I gave chat GPT uh links to the settlement. It was a big enough one that it would made the national news. So I

1:09:57: gave it a bunch of article links uh to that settlement information and said hey I want you to add this settlement into

1:10:03: the local business schema. So then chat GPT regenerated the schema. It added a

1:10:08: reward. I think they called it a reward and put it underneath the uh attorney

1:10:13: subcategory. So it ends up being this crazy complicated nested schema. No

1:10:18: problem. Chat GPT does it. Great job. double check it on Google's uh structured data testing tool to make

1:10:24: sure no errors, no warnings. Implement it on the website. A week later, ask chat GPT to recommend attorneying that

1:10:31: town and it repeats literally word for word the information that was in the

1:10:36: schema markup about that settlement. And we've seen that over and over again. If if you put information like uh FAQ

1:10:44: schema is another great one. Let me let me show let me show another prompt that we started uh playing with and it's it's

1:10:51: really cool what it does. It's it's uh uh

1:10:56: there it is. Um share screen. Share screen. So I'm

1:11:04: not a very creative person. I called it the the Reddit threadfinder. So, what this prompt does is it's going to go to

1:11:10: Reddit and other local uh business forms uh in your area for your type of

1:11:16: business, and it's going to pull up the type of comments, questions, things that

1:11:21: people are talking about in your area about your type of business, right? So, if you're in Miami, it's not going to

1:11:27: talk about, you know, a furnace, furnace repair. But if you're in Minneapolis, furnace repair might be a really big

1:11:33: deal. Um, if you're in Chicago, uh, uh, replacing a lead main drain line might

1:11:39: be a big deal. Chicago is an old city. If you're in Houston, there aren't very many lead drain lines. Houston's a much

1:11:45: newer city, right? So, it's going to find these things and it's going to generate suggested FAQs about those very

1:11:52: specific topics that people are asking about in your region, about your service. Then you expand upon those

1:12:00: FAQs, uh, write it and you implement an FAQ schema that you nest inside your

1:12:06: local business schema. And then when someone asks chat GPT, hey, I have a

1:12:12: lead main drain line that I need replaced. Who would you recommend? It's going to say, Joe the plumber has been

1:12:20: replacing lead main drain lines in Chicago for 25 years. and it will almost word for word pull from the FAQ schema

1:12:28: that you implemented. It's kind of crazy how how easy it is to like feed chat GPT

1:12:35: words that it repeats to people. Yeah, it's wild.

1:12:40: All right, I got kind ofated there. Sorry. I I I went Yeah. No, because I think again

1:12:48: there's a there's a a massive opportunity just in SEO and um I want and I get annoyed when people say that

1:12:55: it's dead and you know nobody goes actually you and I talked about this two years ago on my YouTube

1:13:01: and were you wrong? No, I saidformational searches are dead.

1:13:07: Yeah, blogs. Yeah. So what when we think about local

1:13:13: businesses, right, we're quite a ways from AI being able to actually replace your water heater. Oh yeah, I think so.

1:13:19: Um so when we think about Google versus chat GPT versus any and none of the

1:13:25: other AI programs matter, right? Like 98% of recommendations are coming from

1:13:31: chat GPT. Um, so trying to optimize for like grock or perplexity or something is

1:13:38: the same thing as saying I do SEO for Bing, right? Like time. Why would you do that? Optimize for chat GPT and don't

1:13:44: worry about the rest. Um, but if you think about it, what Google did that I I talked about,

1:13:50: uh, Google has spent the last 25 years trying to figure out how to decide what

1:13:56: is a trustworthy business based only on information they can find online, right?

1:14:02: And chat GPT is now doing the exact same thing. It's the exact same problem. How can chat GPT recommend a business based

1:14:10: only on information they can find on top uh find online? And no surprise, often

1:14:16: their recommendations are pretty similar to one another. If you like your Bing for business or

1:14:22: stuff like that, then they're not going to be. But as long as you get these basic stuff right, you can usually rank

1:14:28: in both. And yeah, market suite, uh, set it right. If you're in the Google map pack and chat GBT is is is is

1:14:35: recommending you, the sales call is who do I give my credit card number to? Right. Yeah, it's crazy. Um,

1:14:45: I'm going to just let me just shoot off some questions that people had. I didn't notice that came in. Do you adjust the

1:14:50: rank map to the size of their service area? So, if there's something specific, we

1:14:57: will. Usually I'm pretty lazy, so I'll just run whatever the default is, which is 13 m by 13 mi. Uh works out to 169

1:15:05: square miles. That's pretty big. Um if we need to for whatever reason, so we have a a client who's a plastic surgeon

1:15:12: in New York City. Uh for them, we made the rank map quite a bit smaller because, you know, you're not going to

1:15:17: rank in 170 square miles in Manhattan, right? Uh but on the other hand in

1:15:23: Chicago we are ranking in 169 square miles around Chicago. So usually we just

1:15:28: leave it whatever the default is. Got it. Um

1:15:34: let me look here. Are you looking on yours? I'm looking on. Yeah. So let's see. Uh say what if it's

1:15:41: not a service area business? Is this still relevant? So a service area business that means that there's no

1:15:47: address no visible address on the Google business profile. Uh we will not take

1:15:52: clients that are a service area business. Uh it is much much harder to

1:15:58: rank a service area business like 50 to 100% harder. It's often less expensive.

1:16:05: Usually you'd be a service area business because you don't want your uh primary residence address to be visible. But

1:16:11: it's going to often be easier, cheaper to rent an office and make it a visible

1:16:18: address than it is to rank a service area business. Um, but I'm not sure I

1:16:23: understand the question. What if it's not a service area business? Maybe you mean like what if it's like a LASIC eye

1:16:29: surgeon where somebody comes to you, then yes, it's still relevant. If you're a restaurant, it's still relevant. You're trying to rank across the map

1:16:35: pack regardless if you go there or they come to you. Got it. Uh, let me just shoot these off really

1:16:42: quick. Uh, you aren't trying to get the actual website ranked then. No, we're

1:16:47: trying to get it ranked in the Google business. The Google business trying to get the Google business profile ranked, not the website.

1:16:52: Okay. And real quick, just because somebody did ask, this is a very good question. Carrie asked, "What's the difference between uh I guess they went

1:16:58: and looked you up, the $27 per month school and the 197 per month school? What's the difference?"

1:17:04: Right. So, the 197 is like over the shoulder step by step. This is exactly how we do local SEO at my agency. Uh the

1:17:12: $27 group has a bunch of AI prompts um all of which I featured on the YouTube

1:17:19: channel. It has a course called modern SEO which sort of gives the basics of

1:17:24: what modern SEO is ranking for AI using AI to rank on Google. And both of them

1:17:30: have a community and I'm active in there. I try to answer every single question. Um the pro group uh we do a

1:17:37: weekly Zoom call uh where anyone who wants to join can. We answer all their questions. Uh we do that in the modern

1:17:44: SEO group, the $27 group, but that's only once a month. Got it. And I actually dropped a link

1:17:49: because I know somebody was asking me for the link. So I dropped a link also uh on my YouTube channel. If you're on Caleb's, he could drop his own link. Um

1:17:59: or his link is probably everywhere. Uh but I I'll say that I'll say this because I don't want to is that I

1:18:04: actually use I'm I'm in Caleb's group and I follow his uh instructions through

1:18:11: the school community um for stuff that I'm working on in my own agency. Uh but I do want to actually ask you this

1:18:17: question. I know you get a lot of clients on Upwork. Okay.

1:18:22: Yeah. What that's how I built my first uh seven figureure agency on Upwork. Yeah. Yeah. And so my question is this, and

1:18:28: because this is gonna be a I'm actually starting to do this for myself. Why not rank in your local area, your

1:18:36: own marketing agency? I feel like this is like the most hidden gem

1:18:41: for even in my coaching program, the local marketing vault, you know, everybody's like, I can't get clients. I

1:18:47: can't get clients. How do I get clients? He's like, yo, we give you nine ways to get clients. Upwork is like the number one way. Warm market is another one way.

1:18:54: uh doubletapping trials on and on local BNI groups I mean there's a million ways

1:19:00: right so it's just people just are scared but when an inbound lead comes it's a lot easier conversation what's

1:19:07: your thought on that absolutely and that's a method that we talk about quite a bit like like build

1:19:13: an agency website use these same methods to rank it one of the challenges with

1:19:18: ranking an agency website is often SEO agency websites are what I like to call

1:19:24: as overlin meaning they have more links than you would expect given the city size. The reason for that is a lot of

1:19:31: SEO agencies will put links from their client sites back to the agency site. So

1:19:37: they end up having a lot of local uh authority links just because they're doing that. But if you're in an area

1:19:44: that doesn't have that or if you're in an area that does have it and you just join a bunch of chambers to get over it anyway, uh the conversation that you

1:19:51: have with people who found you on Google is a much easier conversation than the one that you have with people that you

1:19:57: ran ads to or something like that. Yeah. Yeah. I'm actually going to start doing that in my I have about a 100,000 people

1:20:04: now in my town. Maybe more now. Or maybe like 70 to

1:20:10: 100,000. And um there's literally no marketing agencies here.

1:20:15: Oh, well, perfect. Yeah. Now, the search volume is low, but you might get one or two inbound leads a month.

1:20:23: Yeah. Uh somebody asked the lead snap tool, is it only to show heat maps? No. Uh you

1:20:30: No, the core thing that we do

1:20:35: snap tool is the citations. Um, and Crypto Billings asked if it works for service area businesses. Probably, but

1:20:40: honestly, I don't know because we don't work with service area businesses. Like, it's impossible to rank them. So, we don't work with them because I'm not

1:20:45: going to take on a client that I don't think I can show results for. Uh, so I don't have any experience trying to use lead snap with service area businesses.

1:20:51: What What do you mean service area businesses? Like, what a service area business means a GBP that has a um not does not have a visible

1:20:58: address. So, it's a hidden address. Oh. Oh, right. Right. So, if I was a marketing agency and worked out of my

1:21:04: home, I would have an invisible address. It would be impossible to rank. Exactly. And what I would say if you're

1:21:10: in that situation, I would say display your primary residence address. That's fine. Google doesn't care. And if you

1:21:16: don't want to for whatever reason, then get an office space. Like, there's so many office vacancies. We had

1:21:22: a client, we got them an office space in like downtown Denver for $500 a month.

1:21:27: Like, office space cheap. Yeah. And it's worth it especially it captures now that area

1:21:33: as well um for proact and mckesh 45 services and 16 service

1:21:39: areas. So you would have 45 service pages the service areas they are uh all

1:21:44: the testing I've done and I've done a lot uh the service areas mean absolutely nothing. Uh fill it out because we

1:21:50: always fill it out. That's the area on the GBP where the it says like what areas do you serve and you can put zip

1:21:56: codes and stuff in. Um, so I I mentioned we had 97 uh plumber clients in six

1:22:01: months. So sometimes they don't pay their invoice and that I see as an opportunity to do some split testing to

1:22:08: see what happens when we do things. And one of the things that we tested was, hey, what happens if the plumber is in

1:22:14: California and we put a bunch of Zip codes for Manhattan in their GBP? And

1:22:19: what happened to the rank position was absolutely nothing. It didn't move. Didn't it? So service areas, they don't

1:22:25: do anything. Uh, fill them out, but don't like you don't have to do 45* 16. It does. No, just the 45.

1:22:32: Just the 45. Yeah, makes sense. I don't have any other questions on my end.

1:22:38: Awesome. All right. Well, cool. Yeah. So, I dropped a link. Um, if you I

1:22:44: mean, honestly, you can go back a year and what Caleb put together in this 197 a month group

1:22:51: is a10 $15,000 coaching program in my opinion. Um, for

1:22:57: $197 a month and like, you know, if you need it for six months and then you learn it all yourself, so be it. If you

1:23:03: need it in three months, uh, but you're definitely going to learn a ton of stuff. I use it and I've been in the game since 2014. Um, I will say that we

1:23:12: have in in the 197 group, we have 219 members currently and my churn rate is

1:23:18: uh 2%. Yeah, people stay. People stay. Yeah,

1:23:23: it's a lot easier. It's a lot easier to, in my opinion, to pay 197 a month to to

1:23:28: constantly have that to turn to rather than try to create your own, you know,

1:23:33: create all of that same content for yourself, for your team. And uh and then

1:23:39: you know eventually I mean you just copy and paste prompts what you know core 30 laid out for you.

1:23:47: So and if you have any questions we do a weekly call you can post in the group you can send me a message. Yeah.

1:23:52: Yeah. So uh that link is pinned and uh Carrie asked again what tool actually

1:23:58: creates the heat maps. Uh leenap will create the heat map. It does multiple things.

1:24:05: It also has a CRM, but I don't I don't use the CRM functionality and and to get the You probably have a

1:24:11: link in there as well, right? To join Leadnap. Yeah, I do have a Lead Snap affiliate link. Um I know it's an affiliate link,

1:24:18: but if if you do decide to check it out, the affiliate link will actually give you uh it'll double the free trial and

1:24:25: it will give you half off the first three months. Um there you go.

1:24:30: So, it's a pretty it's a pretty good affiliate deal. Patrick was Patrick owns Lead Snap. He was um he was willing to

1:24:36: work with me on because it always feels so scuzzy to be like here's my affiliate link. You know what I mean?

1:24:44: Yeah, but if they're going to go buy it anyway, why not? Yeah. Well, I'll I'll give it to you and

1:24:49: we'll if we'll track anyone who signs up from this, we'll we'll we'll make sure. Yeah.

1:24:55: All right. Yeah. And I have the link, too. I'll I'll drop his link uh in the actually once this thing ends. Does it

1:25:02: have like a descript? Whatever. I'll figure out how to get that link. But it's in

1:25:08: the course. Uh his link is pinned on my end. I'm good. I think we I think we went deeper than I thought we were going

1:25:13: to go deep. Yeah, that was uh a bit more than I was expecting. My kids are probably wondering where I am because I got to go

1:25:19: make them dinner. Oh boy. Well, your wife's working. She is. She's working tonight.

1:25:24: Wow. It's a late night. They're playing Civilization 7. So So they don't care. They're They're

1:25:31: probably excited that they get to play video games later. Yeah, the Xbox is an excellent uh babysitter sometimes.

1:25:38: Oh, no. It definitely definitely is. My son plays um something on his computer. I think he's still playing Fortnite,

1:25:44: believe it or not. He's 13. Fortnite. Hey, I mean, there's nothing wrong with falling some falling in love with something.

1:25:49: Yeah, I'm trying to get I want to sign him up for that like AI kids course. There's like a kids course you can sign

1:25:55: him up for. Kids, my son. Okay, so I I've been talking about this quite a bit, right? So I

1:26:01: don't know, this is a whole other topic. Maybe we need to do another live stream. Uh but just real quick, I just got So uh

1:26:08: entry level hiring is like way way down across everything, uh across all big

1:26:14: companies. Uh so I mean I'm glad I'm not in college right now. I'm glad my kids aren't in college or in high school.

1:26:19: They're a little bit younger, uh middle school, elementary school. Uh but it would be a tough time to try to find a job right now. Um, and what's happening,

1:26:27: so the companies, the AI can't do people's jobs, right? Like you can't hire, you can't use AI to just replace

1:26:35: someone. Uh, what what's happening is they have experts who are running AI and

1:26:40: then replacing 10 or 15 new hires. Yeah. Um,

1:26:46: so to get hired, to be valuable uh in this world, you basically need to know

1:26:52: how to run AI. you need to understand the limitations of AI. So, one of the things that I'm going to have my kids do

1:26:59: um is they're going to build and train their own AI model on a local machine.

1:27:06: Uh and they can train on whatever they want. I think they decided they're going to train it on Civilization 7 strategies, which is fine. The point is

1:27:13: like understanding how to build and train a model uh is so much more valuable than probably anything else

1:27:20: they're going to learn in school for where the world is going. one of their teachers gave them an assignment and it

1:27:27: was just like write write a paragraph describing the relative location of Florida and the teacher said feel free

1:27:33: to use chat GPT for this assignment which is a sign that the teacher has never used chat GPT doesn't know what it

1:27:39: can do because that you just screenshot the or take a photo of the assignment

1:27:44: give it a chat GPT and you're done right there's more interesting better questions if you want the kids to engage

1:27:51: with chat GPT in a way that engages crit critical thinking skills like even just like okay what sources did it use how

1:27:58: did it come up with those answers right but the teachers don't know how to you how to incorporate chat GPT because it's

1:28:05: so new so anyway I would 100% support getting your kids into like these

1:28:10: beginner AI courses and get deeper and deeper only downside with building your own model on a local machine is damn the

1:28:18: Nvidia uh Nvidia graphics units are expensive these days yeah I was going to ask you how the hell do you build your own model. I don't get

1:28:24: how I don't understand it. Yeah. So, you you uh you can download uh

1:28:29: like the PyTorch uh it's coded in Python, but uh Claude ChatgPT can do a

1:28:36: lot of the heavy lifting for the coding up front and then when you run it on your local machine, uh you can see how

1:28:42: it's using the different resources, the GPU, and you have to work to optimize that. You give it a data set to train it

1:28:48: on. Uh, so yeah, it's a whole big thing, but man, I think that would be so valuable to learn. Um, versus, you know,

1:28:56: just typing things into the box like 99.9% of users. Yeah. I don't know. I might just be

1:29:02: typing things into a box. Oh, I type things into box. I'm not learning how to do all that. That's

1:29:07: That's what my kids can do. Yeah, exactly. That's funny. All right, man. I appreciate your time as always. We'll

1:29:13: talk. We'll chat. Enjoy uh your dinner. I'm about to have mine. and everybody that watched, appreciate you watching on

1:29:18: my channel and on yours. That worked out pretty well. So, awesome. Thank you, James. Pleasure to have you on my channel and a pleasure to

1:29:25: be on yours. Take care. Sounds good. All right. Appreciate it. Thanks.
