- **description**: ðŸ“Œ Executive Summary

This weekly call covered advanced local SEO strategies with a strong focus on AI optimization, including LLM landing pages, schema implementation, and citation building. The discussion emphasized practical applications of AI for local businesses and addressed community questions about indexing, ranking, and best practices for maintaining search visibility.

ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways





Schema is crucial for AI/LLM visibility - ChatGPT relies heavily on structured data, much more than Google does



LLM landing pages - Create dedicated pages optimized for AI search engines rather than human users



Citations take time but work - Lead Snap's automated citation building is effective but requires patience (1-2 weeks)



Avoid major website changes - Even small design changes can cause significant ranking drops that take months to recover



Reddit strategy for AI - Participate in local subreddits and do AMAs to build brand mentions for LLM recognition

ðŸ“Š Main Discussion Points

AI Search Optimization





Key points: Schema markup, citations, and Reddit participation are the main ranking factors for AI search



Insights: ChatGPT uses reviews and brand mentions more heavily than Google does



Actionable tips: Create FAQ sections with local language patterns, add nested schema for awards/achievements

LLM Landing Pages





Key points: Build pages specifically for AI search engines with heavy social proof and review widgets



Insights: Include business owner bios, credentials, patient testimonials with transcripts



Actionable tips: Link to press releases and media mentions, add FAQ sections targeting local search patterns

Website Indexing Issues





Key points: Reasonable indexing time is within one week for healthy sites



Insights: Use Index Meow or similar tools if pages aren't indexing after 2+ weeks



Actionable tips: Ensure internal links, sitemaps, and external links are present before troubleshooting

Ranking Preservation





Key points: Any website changes can cause ranking drops, even hosting moves



Insights: Recovery can take 3+ months, even with identical content



Actionable tips: Only add content, never change existing elements when ranking well

ðŸ’¡ Notable Q&A

Q: How do you convince clients to allow specials in GBP posts? A: Don't worry about it - no one reads GBP posts. They're just for showing activity to Google. Make specials match regular pricing or be vague.

Q: What's reasonable time for page indexing? A: Within a week for healthy sites. Check Search Console index reports and use tools like Index Meow if needed after 2+ weeks.

Q: How does proximity work with "near me" searches? A: Near me searches prioritize proximity more than city searches. Building more trust and relevance helps overcome proximity factors.

Q: Should I change my website design if ranking well? A: No. Even small changes can cause major ranking drops. Only add content, never modify existing elements when performing well.

ðŸ”® Emerging Trends & Challenges





AI search vs. Google Maps disconnect - Same queries produce different business recommendations between AI overview and map pack



Schema importance growing - LLMs rely much more heavily on structured data than traditional search



Reddit's rising influence - Both Google and LLMs increasingly favor Reddit content for local recommendations



Video content limitations - ChatGPT can't process videos, requiring transcripts for AI optimization

ðŸ›  Tools & Resources Mentioned





Lead Snap - Citation building and local rank mapping (preferred over Local Dominator)



Index Meow - Page indexing assistance tool



Ice Cream Truck Shop - PBN link source ($35/link)



QGP (Quality Guest Posts) - Alternative PBN provider



High Level - CRM and chat bot integration



Send Spark - Cold email outreach tool ($200/month)

0:03: All right, welcome, welcome everyone. It is Thursday, August 7th at 1:00 central. So, thank

0:11: you everyone for coming. I know we usually meet on Tuesdays and it is obviously not Tuesday. Uh, but I had a

0:18: lastm minute trip to uh Austin earlier this week, so couldn't do

0:24: our regular scheduled call. Um, I did want to mention a couple of things. So,

0:30: last Tuesday, and I know that was the first one we did in a couple of weeks. Uh, but we went a little long. And when

0:36: I say a little long, I am being kind of, uh, light on that. I think we finished

0:43: at like 3:30. Uh, so the challenge with that, my kids

0:48: are back in school, which means I need to leave here at about 2:30 to go get them. That's in an hour and a half. So,

0:55: we're going to end in an hour and a half. So, I was looking at what we did

1:01: last week about what we've been doing, trying to come up with a way to do this fair and reasonable. So, what I'm going

1:07: to try, and if you guys hate it, let me know. We can always adjust from there. But for this first pass, I think what

1:14: I'm going to try is just saying no follow-up questions. Okay? So, raise

1:19: your hand, ask your question. If you have follow-up questions, just raise your hand again and that'll put you at

1:26: the end of the queue. Okay? Cuz there were people last Tuesday who were here for like 2 and 1/2 hours before I got to

1:33: answer their question. So, I think it would just be a lot more reasonable if we just said no follow-up questions. Put

1:38: your hand down back up again. Then we'll get to you again if we have time. Let me know if you guys think that is

1:44: reasonable. What I'll also do, and again, if you want to ask the question

1:49: on the Zoom uh verbally with your hand up, no problem at all. But what I'll also do is in between each hand up

1:57: question, I'm going to go ahead and look at all of the questions I got via chat and try to answer all of them before

2:04: going to the next handup question. So, if you have just a quick simple question, something you can type out,

2:10: feel free to knock that in there. If you have a follow-up question about something that we're talking about, feel free to throw it in the chat and I'll

2:16: get to it before I go to the next hands-up question. So, the quickest way to get your question answered is then

2:21: obviously in the chat. Um, but happy to do the verbal ones still. Uh, we are I

2:28: think I do have to get away uh from the verbal questions in the larger community

2:33: group where everyone is invited, but I don't want to get rid of it here uh because this is the pro community. So, I

2:40: wanted to come up with a way where you guys could still join the Zoom, could still ask a verbal question and uh yeah,

2:46: cool. People seem to be okay with it. So, we'll go with that for now and if we need to make adjustments, we'll um we'll

2:53: figure it out. Yeah. Uh cool. And yeah, Kyle, thanks for that. Yes, lead snap

2:58: actually has excellent support uh which you know very different from some other

3:04: tools that will remain nameless uh but rhyme with my mel uh that have

3:12: absolutely terrible support uh so you know lead snap actually is very good

3:17: about it. It's something that I know Patrick prides himself on. He's done a great job with it. Let me know guys if

3:23: you would have any interest. I'm sure if I asked Patrick, he would be happy to come on one of these, we could do one

3:28: dedicated to talking about uh lead snap. If you guys think that's interesting, let me know. If not, we don't have to,

3:35: but if there's enough interest, it does take time to get the citations, but it doesn't take a lot of your time, right?

3:42: You just have to do the one thing and then give it a week or two. It has the API connections. There might be a couple

3:48: of uh follow-up actions that you need to take, but it's not it's nothing like

3:53: trying to get the citations yourself is the point I want to make. It's so much faster and easier than getting them yourself. And hopefully you're not

4:00: running SEO with some sense of emergency behind it, right? I remember I was

4:06: talking with a client today and he was just like, "Do you have a developer where I can send you something and you'll have it ready like the next

4:11: morning?" And it's just like, "Sure don't." Like why would you need it ready that fast? just if you need it in a

4:18: week, just give it a week in advance and we'll have it ready for you in a week. But no, I can't do an overnight

4:24: turnaround because why would I why would I build up my system, my processes to manage an overnight turnaround for SEO?

4:30: It usually takes months to make something happen. Uh my rank maps only run every other week. Um and usually

4:38: there's not much change. Every once in a while there is, and that's really cool to see because then I'm like, great, new YouTube video whenever I see that. Um,

4:45: and it happens, but not super often. But, okay, enough of the preamble. Billy, how are you doing this afternoon?

4:53: Great. Great. How you doing, Caleb? Doing what? You're always Johnny on the spot. I feel like every time you're on, you're the first one with a hand up. So,

5:01: I don't know about that, but yeah, I I missed the last missed last week, but uh any event. Yeah. Uh I was I've actually

5:09: done your I guess your uh uh structure. I'm on my fifth client now doing it and

5:16: uh it's working pretty well. I've had actually some people move up in the map pack and it's working. So

5:22: yeah, it's it's working well. I I have a question on the endless post though the what what you call the

5:28: endless post and I took your endless post basically uh I cut and pasted put

5:35: it in chat GBT and had a questionnaire that I sent out to clients and have them fill out the questionnaire to get the

5:41: endless post. But I guess like my problem with it is how do you convince

5:46: people to allow you to do specials or just to have have you do some type of of of of uh you know offer that is going to

5:55: get people to actually respond to you or actually or you are or are you really trying to do that? And secondly is if

6:01: you do do that that's a great question. I'm I'm going to cut you off. That sure sounds like a follow-up question but anyway so that's

6:06: a good question. So the way that we manage that, right, no one reads GBP posts, right? When was the last time you

6:12: read a GBP post? That was going to be my next question. Yeah. Okay. So no one reads them. It

6:17: doesn't matter. Uh the GBP posts are just to show activity to Google. So if

6:22: they have a special or followup, then sure, go ahead and put it in the GBP post and send it out. Maybe one guy is

6:29: reading the GBP post and he'll get super excited about the special, maybe. Um, but generally when we're doing the

6:36: specials, we're just going to make the specials match the regular pricing. Uh, or not mention pricing, being like,

6:42: "Hey, we have a special onback tuneup cuz it's spring now. Call us to find out more." Uh, but yeah, and the only reason

6:51: for that is just because I find it not worth the time to get alignment with the

6:56: client on what we're going to say in the GBP post because no one is going to read the GBP post. the the the posts are

7:03: really they should be something that you spend five minutes on and then you just never think about it for another year.

7:10: Uh because that's really all they're doing, right? Am I making sense with that? Oh yeah, that makes perfect sense. It

7:17: takes a lot of pressure off. Just throw something up there and doesn't really matter. Throw something up there. Exactly. Uh

7:23: exactly. Thanks a lot. Absolutely. Cool. All right. Uh Christie asks, "What's a reasonable time for a

7:28: page to get indexed?" Uh uh so if you requested it at 5:30, so

7:34: you requested it at the end of May and you actually requested indexing in the search console in 721, which is still 3

7:41: weeks ago, um maybe two weeks ago, you should see something in the search console about why that isn't indexed. If

7:48: it isn't indexed, uh it shouldn't take two weeks. Uh what I was going to say is

7:55: probably within a week if the site is healthy, Google's regularly looking at it uh to get it crawled. If it's been

8:01: that long, then there's probably something else going on. So what you want to do is if you go into the Google Search Console, uh on the lefth hand

8:08: rail, one of the options is something like index status or index report, something like that. So, if you go

8:14: there, you'll see all the categories of pages and hopefully you'll see the URL that you're worried about called out in

8:20: one of those categories. Uh, at least it should be discovered, not crawled, uh,

8:26: after that long. And if it's not even discovered, not crawled, what we'll often do, um, and honestly,

8:34: we'll often do it even if it's been a couple of weeks and we're not getting indexed. Um, let me just drop it. It's

8:40: not an affiliate or anything. It's not free, but it's pretty inexpensive. Uh, it's just called Index Me Now. There's a

8:45: bunch of tools like this. They just basically help you get content indexed faster. Uh, it's not something we have

8:51: to use very often because usually indexing is just natural and happens on its own. But again, if you're waiting as

8:58: long as that, uh, it might be something worth looking at if you're having trouble getting it indexed. Make sure

9:03: you so you have the PBN link. Make sure you have internal links pointed to it. Uh, orphan pages are really hard to get

9:10: indexed. Make sure you have internal links pointed to it and make sure it's on your site map. If you have internal links, it's on your sitemap and an

9:17: external link and it's not getting indexed, then we might use index me now. Yeah. So, no referring site maps. So,

9:23: you know, create a site map. Um, all right, Davidid, how are you?

9:28: Hello, KB. I'm good. And you? Doing well, thank you. Uh so my question this question will be

9:37: uh about AI search optimization because you I maybe I I missed something but I

9:43: think so far you're just talking about uh citation and uh schema which are

9:49: helping for AI search. Is there anything else? There's a couple of other little things but yeah that's the bulk of it.

9:55: Absolutely. And what is the couple of other things? I mean, can you There's some tips in there about using

10:00: Reddit, uh, Chatg GPT. Other LLMs are obsessed with Reddit. Honestly, so is

10:05: Google. Um, so doing like an AMA or just being just participating uh in like a

10:12: local subreddit uh or a subreddit about your

10:17: service area. Uh, and you don't even need to mention the company name in the

10:23: post that you do. If you uh have the company brand in your profile uh and

10:29: then you just post with that profile, the LL uh the LLM chat GPT at least can

10:35: connect that and see that the business owner of that website is the one doing the posting. So, we've seen good results

10:41: with that. Um but the other good one is once you get to a point where you have a reasonable reasonable amount of karma on

10:47: Reddit, so not like the day after you create it, but you've been valuable, you've been helpful, you answered questions, etc., etc., Then you can do

10:55: uh what we'll see we'll do quite a bit is we'll do post on the city's subreddit

11:01: and like hey I've been a plumber for 10 years ask me anything you want about plumbing and then you know we'll get a

11:08: handful of comments and just provide helpful answers and feedback to that. Yeah. I interrupted though was so you

11:14: were asking about how to rank in uh chat GPT. Yes. Yes. No that's that's answering my

11:19: question. I just missed the Reddit stuff. Yeah. And the other big one, so yeah, we

11:25: have the uh um the the schema, the super citations, uh

11:33: being active on a page like Reddit. I say Reddit, I mean, of course, uh like Facebook local groups, stuff like that

11:38: helpfuls because you got to what chat GPT is looking for is brand mentions, right? It wants to see your brand name

11:45: mentioned. Uh so you could even do a press release and that'll get a lot of brand mentions at a lot of high-end uh

11:52: domains for to build that trust. And another one that we would do is creating

11:59: like um a landing page that basically is designed for chat GPT like a chat GPT

12:07: focused landing page where we're going to design it for conversion for chat GPT

12:13: instead of users. So, we're in the process of doing this now for the LASIK

12:19: uh client we work with in Chicago. So, we're basically building a page targeting like LASIK Chicago uh Chicago

12:26: LASIK, but instead of a GBP homepage, we're optim landing page, we're optimizing it for the chat GPT. So,

12:35: there's a ton of social proof, right? Uh there's a review widget, a bunch of

12:40: featured reviews. Chat GPT loves reviews that it uses them much more often than Google does. Especially if with that

12:46: review widget, we want to highlight reviews that specifically mention the services that the people had done. Like,

12:53: oh, they did a great job with this surgery or, "Oh, they did a great job with this or whatever." because chat GPT

13:00: will read those reviews, look at what people are mentioning that happened in the reviews, the specific service that

13:06: was performed, and then regurgitate that information to a user who's asking Chat GPT for it. So, we want to highlight

13:12: those reviews on this landing page. Um, we might do like a well, we'll we'll

13:18: look to do a short uh patient testimonial video. Uh, we'll also have that video mentioned Chicago. Uh, we'll

13:24: put a transcript of that video on the page. Also, I don't think ChatGPT can watch videos. Uh, so we'll we'll do that

13:30: video and then put the transcript on there. The business owner, there's going to be a section that just basically just

13:37: highlights that business owner, right? A photo, uh, a bio, uh, credentials,

13:42: awards. We'll link out to any pages that have mentioned them in the media. That would be an interesting place. If you

13:48: did a press release, you might link out to a page that then links out to all of the press release pages just to make it

13:54: easier for chat GPT. It finds your landing page. It looks at the bio. You link to the press release page and then

14:01: you link to all of the uh mentions just to make sure it can find everything. Sometimes it's not great. Uh and the key

14:07: one uh well another key one uh a section on like why Chicago patients will choose

14:14: this business. And then we'll just talk about all of the things that people say is great about this business and why

14:21: they're choosing this business. And then the last thing that we'll do there is like an FAQ section with with obviously

14:28: with FAQ schema and then we'll uh address um uh you know costs uh why

14:35: LASIK why other types uh what about the business owner questions about him

14:40: questions about recovery about risks. I actually have a prompt. Um, I haven't even recorded it yet, but it's going to

14:47: be in a another YouTube video where I talk about getting featured by um,

14:55: chat GPT and whatnot. So, let me drop the prompt in this chat. Is that sure

15:01: enough? Perfect. Okay. So, I'm going to break it into two chats, but it's basically a prompt that gets chat GPT to

15:07: go and find out what people are talking about for your type of business in your

15:13: area, right? So, it it's going to look on. So, if you have a plumber in Chicago, obviously the people in Chicago

15:19: are going to talk about plumbers differently than the people in Miami. Uh, so that prompt, it does really well.

15:26: I've really enjoyed the output. It's basically going to get chatgpt to go onto Reddit, to go on to Trustpilot, all

15:33: the Angie's List and find out what are people in Chicago talking about for a plumber. And then we're going to take

15:38: that content and turn it into an FAQ on this uh quote unquote LLM landing page.

15:44: And then of course we'll embed the GVP and then we'll have directions uh from a variety of different Chicago

15:50: neighborhoods to the business location. So yeah, we're calling that sort of an LLM landing page. Um, and I am working

15:58: on putting together another lesson to talk about that in a little bit more detail in the training uh in the course

16:05: training. Uh, don't have it yet. Uh, we only just started working on uh the details for that.

16:12: So, perfect. Hopefully that was helpful. Um, yes. Can I It's not followup. It's just

16:18: the landing page. You said the landing page, but it's where people are landing from where? From where? because it's

16:24: it's nowhere that people can find it, right? You you just link to it from your GVP landing page. Uh something like

16:30: that. Like the goal of this is to just spell it out for the LLMs. Uh why that

16:37: business in that location is so good. Like that's that's the the goal of it. It's it's only for the LLMs. Um and

16:46: the reason I don't have a lesson yet about this in the training is we haven't created one of these yet. So, this is

16:52: sort of our our first pass. You know, how is this going to work? Is this going to actually be able to change what chat

16:58: GPT says? That being said, okay, this is kind of like a bonus thing. The schema,

17:03: the structured data is so freaking critical. you would not. So, one of my clients, a personal injury attorney,

17:09: they had like a $30 million settlement uh from a county from a county, some

17:18: some somebody was diabetic, like type 1 diabetes, and they died in jail because they weren't given insulin. Uh, so then

17:25: they bounty because that's obviously horrible and um

17:32: dollars or something because they shouldn't let people with type 1 diabetes die because they don't get insulin. Anyway, so we added a blurb

17:40: about that. So they had local business schema and inside that local business schema they had nested attorney schema

17:47: and then inside that attorney schema we nested schema for an award and then we

17:53: put a blurb talking about that uh settlement and then provided a link to it on the Washington Post or something

18:00: like that that it had gotten national attention. Uh, and within like a week of

18:05: doing that, when we asked Chad GPT to recommend uh an attorney in the city that they're located in, not only were

18:12: they recommending my client, but it was recommending my client and specifically mentioning that settlement, right? So,

18:18: Chat GPT reads schema so much. It it relies so much on schema much more than

18:23: Google does. So, if you're trying to get chat GPT to say specific things about you or a client of yours, put it in the

18:31: schema. And I am like I don't know, I can't say 100%, but I'll say I'm 98%

18:36: confident that there's a way that you can nest schema into the GBP landing

18:42: page to highlight whatever the hell you want to highlight to chat GPT and it will listen to the schema. Uh, sorry,

18:49: LLM is large language model. It's basically chatgpt, claude, gemini, gro,

18:55: all of those. People call AI, but the technically correct term is LLM. Uh, and

19:01: of course, I can't do anything that's not technically correct, so I I often try to call it an LLM. All right,

19:08: perfect. Okay, so Michelle asks, "Speaking of PBN's, do you have any experience with turbo subdomains? I've

19:14: never heard of a turbo subdomain. I have no idea what that is." And uh, yep, that's the end of that question because

19:20: you're asking follow-ups on turbo subdomains, which I've never heard of. All right. And Jay, I'm getting some ice

19:25: cream PBNs. What would be good anchor text for a plumber? So, usually when we're doing anchor text, um, we'll we'll

19:33: we'll do maybe a third of them uh, keywordri. So, something like plumber city name, water heater replacement city

19:40: name, whatever you're trying to actually rank for. Don't repeat anchor text, though. Never never do two links with

19:46: the same anchor text. Uh that's a spammy thing to do. Google knows it's spammy. Don't do it. Um anchor text is also less

19:53: important than it was a few years ago. So don't stress about it too much. But anyway, so about a third of them are uh

19:59: keywordri. Uh a third of them are branded or naked. Uh naked meaning just

20:04: the URL. Uh and then branded of course the brand name. And then the last third of them are generic, right? Like read or

20:12: click or information. you know, whatever you want to make the generic ones. Um,

20:18: and that's how we do it. We don't think about it too much. We don't track it. Uh, we just try to make sure we never

20:23: repeat. Um, which means most of the time we're choosing weird anchor text because

20:29: I don't want to track anchor text and I don't want to repeat anchor text. So, it's usually just something really weird. Uh, it's a So, again, I'm So,

20:37: Turbo Subdomain is a PBN seller. I don't buy PBNs from other websites. uh we

20:44: built our own network uh a long time ago and that's the one that we use. Um so

20:49: yeah, I I don't have experience buying external PBNs and throwing them directly

20:55: to a website. I would be nervous about it, but not crazy nervous about it. Like

21:02: on a scale of 1 to 10, I'd be like a five of nervousness because

21:08: what often happens if it's a like very lowquality crappy PBN, it's very likely

21:14: to be de-indexed at some point. Um, which isn't a big deal, right? If it's de-indexed, then the page goes back to

21:21: where it would have been if you had never sourced the link to begin with. It's not like you get penalized. you

21:28: might see your rank drop and it might feel like a penalization, but you're really just going back to where you were before you sourced the link. The link

21:34: just isn't counting anymore. Beyond that, a lot of these PBN links, they're not the ones that you're actually using

21:39: to build trust, right? The links that we're using to build trust are going to be the Chamber of Commerce, the local charities, the local event sponsorships,

21:47: stuff like that. So, these PBN links are really only there to get the content

21:52: indexed. Uh, so again, I don't really care if as long as it's not like

21:58: complete and utter spam. Even if it gets de-indexed, the Google likely won't

22:04: de-index the page that it indexed that you linked the PBN to. Now I sound like that episode from Friends. Um, okay. And

22:12: the last one with your ice cream truck. Yes, we send the ice cream truck shop PBN link straight to the supporting

22:19: content, straight to the GVP landing page, straight to everywhere it needs to be all the time. We just send them

22:24: straight there. Um, they're like, I don't know, 35 bucks a piece, so they're not crazy expensive. If you find a

22:30: better source with higher quality ones, no problem. I know QGP has good links. Um, I've used some of their stuff

22:36: before. Let me send um QGP. It's not quality pool group. I have it linked.

22:44: There it is. Oh, it is this qgp.com. Um, I don't have an affiliate link with them, but I've used links from them

22:50: before. Uh, pretty good. Obviously, I don't use their PBN links, but I've used other types of links. Uh, we used to use

22:57: like Fat Joe. Uh, but Fat Joe is like

23:02: Fat Joe is very expensive, like $150 a link or something like that. Um, so we don't use that much. But QGP, um, I'

23:08: I've had some good luck with them. some solid links. If you don't use the ice cream truck chop, that's that's fine. Alex, how are you? Is this the first

23:15: time you've been here? Yeah, I've been a member for a few months and just kind of been listening

23:21: um and things like that. Awesome. Well, welcome. Yeah, thank you. Um yeah, I'm really enjoying it so far and like I said,

23:27: we're you know, we have a team and we're trying to, you know, start brainstorming

23:32: and implementing stuff. So, we finally starting to get this thing rolling. So, so we're excited about that. And you

23:38: know um I think we're doing we're on the right track. So we've identified a new client. It's just a fresh one coming in.

23:44: So I thought that would be a great opportunity um to try this out. Um I sent it to you in like the school group

23:51: in a message. I don't know like if you got that. I didn't know the easiest way to like share that with you before the

23:56: thing. Um and in the future just you know let me know. Um but mainly I just

24:01: wanted like I had a couple questions just more like validation like okay are we you know are we on the right path? so

24:07: to speak. Um, and so it's a it's a a pool supply store and they also do

24:13: servicing. Um, their website is terrible. We're we are rebuilding the website um now. Um, so kind of ignore

24:20: the existing stuff. And again, that'll give us a good opportunity to kind of build everything right from scratch. And

24:26: then I share with you kind of um you know the uh some of the documents that

24:31: we've been like producing like kind of the initial strategy doc where we you know gave it to the client and they're

24:36: checking off like these are the you know important services and ones you do and don't etc. Um so I think we're on the

24:44: right track there as far as you know laying everything out and organizing. um team did have a question like um so if

24:51: our primary category is going to be swimming pool supply store um does does

24:57: it make sense I think it makes sense to point that to the homepage um uh for the

25:02: uh you know or have that content on there for the GDP or does it matter

25:11: um if that makes any like like so they don't build pools then no they sell them but it's mostly

25:18: supplies. Oh, so they literally are a swimming pool supply store. Okay, no problem.

25:24: Which is, you know, some Yeah, like if their main thing is

25:29: selling swimming pool, swimming pool equipment, then absolutely that makes sense as a primary category. And almost

25:35: all of the time, like 90% of the time, the GBP landing page, we're going to

25:41: make it match the primary category. Uh, I for a swimming pool supply store, if

25:46: that's like their main bread and butter, I can't think of a good reason why they wouldn't want their GBP landing page to

25:53: have a title tag in H1 that matches swimming pool supply store. You can obviously include other words in it, but

26:00: you just want to include the exact match for your primary category and city name.

26:06: Got it. And does it matter? you mean or do you recommend it actually being the homepage of the site or designer even

26:12: matter? So, usually we're going to want to do the homepage. The exceptions to that are

26:19: one if it's a multilocation business and this is like a second, third, fourth location because each location will need

26:25: its own GBP landing page. Um, and even in that exception, you're

26:30: still going to use your homepage as one of the GBP landing pages. And the second exception that we would make for that is

26:37: if they're trying to rank the homepage non-locally. Like if you sell swimming

26:42: pool supply equipment, then you have an e-commerce website that does that. Then we would not make the homepage the GBP

26:48: landing page. Uh for reasons that should be obvious. If you use a URL as a GBP

26:55: landing page, that's a pretty compelling signal to Google that you intend that page to rank locally. So, if you're

27:01: trying to rank it non-locally, you'll want to create a different page and then link the GBP to that page while you try

27:08: to rank the rest of the site non-locally. Uh, so that so that type of e-commerce store that'll do stuff like

27:15: that. Uh, or multilocation, those are pretty much the only times that we would not be using the homepage as the GVP

27:20: landing page. Okay, awesome. No, that that's perfect. And like I said, we're going to keep rolling with this and then, you know, I

27:26: might have some followup questions as we start like laying it out because I just want to perfect like do it right once and then we're very good at like

27:32: repeating that process because we got a whole bunch more to like pull into it. Um, but you know, I just want to make sure we're not missing anything. And

27:38: then I know it's like very quick side question, but because you're just talking about PBNs and I can throw in the thing, but like I have my own PVN

27:44: network that's decent like um everything gets indexed and we get traffic and

27:49: stuff like that. I mean is there any like I don't want to say requirement for you know what I mean like I think it

27:55: would be fine but is there anything I should be like you know wary of or anything you know but as long as like

28:00: basically every post I make on any of my PBNs winds up getting index so I would and but there's various degrees of DAS

28:06: on those but no I mean as long as it's indexed then it's usually fine that's one of the cores that we're looking for for PBN.

28:12: Excellent. Jay how are you doing well how about yourself?

28:18: Good. Oh, sorry, Jay. Before I jump on, Derek asked if I'd ever used Matt Diggity's company, and I have not. He

28:24: has very strict requirements uh to use his uh PBN links, and I have never met

28:31: those requirements. I think one of the key ones is you can never have done link building before uh to that domain if you

28:39: want to use the authority builders. So, I have never used it. Um okay, Jay, go

28:45: ahead. Uh just a quick one. I'm opening up a couple more locations, trying to spread

28:51: out a little bit, and I came across something on Google that basically says

28:56: if you're overlapping from the same company, even though they're separate locations, same company,

29:04: how careful do I have to be on the overlapping? I mean, I've broken it down to my areas on my GPP down to almost

29:12: neighborhoods because the cities don't have enough. You know, you got a city and has 20 neighborhoods in it, let's

29:19: say. I'm more worried about going from city to city where they overlap.

29:24: So, the overlap, are you referring to just like the areas we serve on the GBP?

29:30: I Okay. I've got Huntington Beaches, my city. I've got Fountain Valley, which is right next door. I've got Costa Mesa,

29:38: which is a few miles away. If I use Costa Mesa and I go into

29:46: Newport Beach and I use Huntington Beach and it goes into Newport Beach. So when you say use what what like what

29:51: are you actually what are you using on my GBP for location serve?

29:57: Okay. So you are talking about the location service section of the DBP. Yes. Perfect. Uh as far as I can tell and

30:05: I've run a lot of tests on this with like dozens of GBPs. Uh, the location

30:10: served section has nothing to do with ranking. You can put whatever the hell you want in there. You can put that you

30:16: service people who only live in New York City and it will not affect your local rankings whatsoever. I know this because

30:23: I have done that where I went and do a plumber GBP that was ranking pretty well and just put random stuff in the areas

30:30: we serve. Nothing happened to the ranking. As far as I can tell, Google completely ignores that. We always fill

30:36: it out because we always fill out everything on the GVP. But don't stress about what you're putting in that box.

30:42: Just, you know, I think we have a link in the training to a tool that will generate some zip codes or something.

30:48: Just spend five minutes, grab some zip codes, throw them in there, and move on

30:53: with your life. Okay. Yeah. Don't don't stress about it. And

31:00: I'm not exact. It was uh a plumber in um uh California somewhere. I can't

31:06: remember where on the California coast uh like uh north of LA. Uh and they're ranking pretty well. Average rank

31:12: position of like 2.3 or something like that in their area. And you know, I'd

31:18: always wondered like, hey, does that location serve does it do anything? Does it mean anything? So I deleted

31:23: everything. They weren't our client anymore. They were, you know, being  and not settling their invoices.

31:29: So what the hell? they forgot to remove my access to the GBP. Uh, so what a great time to experiment. Uh, so we went

31:35: I went into the GBP, deleted everything in the area served and just said that they served a bunch of zip codes in

31:41: Manhattan like 10001003 one, you know, those types of zip and

31:46: yeah, nothing happened to their rank. It did not move and we left it there for months and then we put it back to their

31:52: actual location. It didn't it didn't have any impact at all. Uh, I'm more worried about two different

31:57: locations serving the same zip code. Nope. I wouldn't worry about it at all. Okay.

32:02: I would not even hesitate or concern like nope. No, no concern whatsoever.

32:09: Guy, how are you? Well, Caleb, how'd everything go with the uh Austin

32:15: trip? It was a new experience. A lot of fun.

32:21: All right. Good. Well, good for you. I mean, it's nice to see you growing. Well, for those of you who don't know, I

32:28: was in Austin earlier this week for uh to film a master class. How cool would

32:33: it be if it was my master class and I was the instructor? That's not what it was, sadly. It was a master class for

32:38: someone else and I was just participating in in the filming. Uh but it was still very cool. Uh it was very

32:45: different being on like an actual production set. Uh like everyone else who was there were like actually actors

32:52: and they're like, "Oh, how long have you been an actor?" I was like, I'm not an actor. Uh, I'm just here. But anyway, so

32:57: it was a lot of fun. It was a good trip to Austin and very weird to try to have a conversation with someone with like 30

33:04: quiet people in the room pointing lights in your face. Uh, yeah, very strange, but anyway.

33:09: Cool. Uh, question on indexing and

33:15: on this page I have 68 index pages that it's all new content. And then I noticed

33:22: the FAQs and all of the enhancements, they weren't populating. So I went through requested reindexing and I see

33:29: them growing uh both for breadcrumbs FAQs um and you know just fixing the issues.

33:36: Um, should I be concerned if there's fewer pages like served over HTTPS or

33:43: fewer breadcrumbs if they're still showing as indexed pages or if you just say, "Hey, they're index because it I

33:50: guess in Google Search Console, how do you know they're really indexed and they're serving serving them up?"

33:56: Right. Well, I mean, it'll be on the index list. Okay. Right. So, there's the uh pages that are

34:01: indexed and then pages that aren't. If it's on the index list, then usually it's indexed. It is kind of weird

34:07: because if you do a site search, which tells you how many pages are indexed, it will never agree with the number that's

34:14: in the search console for number of pages index. They're always going to be some discrepancy. So, I mean, don't

34:19: stress about it too too much, but if it's on the list of pages that are indexed, that's usually a pretty good

34:25: sign that it's been indexed. uh if it says it's not indexed for 404 or you

34:31: know canonical for whatever other reason and it's a page that you want to be indexed then certainly that would be

34:36: something I would send over to my developer like hey go fix this or something. Now, if there's if there's

34:43: old H URLs that you changed the URL and it picked up the

34:49: old one and it has the new one, should you just should you formally go through and say, "Hey, remove these out of the

34:54: index or it'll eventually the old ones will go away on their own." Um, okay. Assuming that there are no

35:02: more links pointed to the old URL, right? So if you have a link pointed to the old URL, then it will

35:11: stay there forever on the index report. Uh even if you do a 301 redirect from

35:16: the old URL to the new one, it will forever and ever be there. Um

35:22: if there's a link pointed to it, obviously uh you should not have any internal links pointed to a 301 redirect

35:29: or internal links pointed to a 404 error. But if you're following the

35:34: system and you got a PBN link or something like that and you've now changed URLs, you're not going to be

35:39: able to update the PBN, right? It's going to stay to the old one. Uh so that'll forever be not indexed due to

35:45: 301 uh until the end of time uh or until Google updates their report. Uh not that

35:51: big of a deal as long as you don't have too many. But that's a key reason why we like hate changing URLs. Um cuz if you

35:59: if you change a URL, it's always just going to sit there and be annoying. Plus, Google doesn't like URL changes,

36:05: so we usually don't like to do that. Yeah. Yeah. Lesson learned on that. Um also,

36:11: so good question here. Go. Sorry, guy. Go ahead. Yeah, go ahead. I just had another Go ahead and answer that question while So,

36:18: let's see. Michelle, uh and I didn't answer this one. Thank you for reminding me, Christie, keeping me honest here. Uh

36:24: I said I would do something like 10 minutes ago, and I'm already not doing it. Okay. So, regarding the prompt, you add the content produced to the money

36:30: site or two. Gen, excuse you. Generally, we'll just add it to the money site. Um,

36:37: we'll just do an FAQ at the bottom and add that type of content to the FAQ. Uh, we're really just trying to mimic the

36:43: language that people are using when they're talking about that type of business in that location so that chat

36:50: GPT is more likely to recommend you. So, we'll just do a little FAQ section at the bottom of the GBP landing page or

36:56: something similar. Uh, all right, Billy, you again. How you doing? Oh, good, good. So, let's talk schema

37:03: and the phrase near me. And so for uh

37:09: for our schema, we're putting all our FAQs and the answers in the schema, but can you do something like how do I find

37:15: the best Dallas wellness center near me as a FAQ? And will that help you get

37:20: near me? If people put best Dallas well talking about chat GPT or Google,

37:27: either one. Will that help with either chat GPT or or Google? So for chat GPT

37:33: proximity is not a rank factor at all. Right? So chat GPT doesn't care about

37:38: proximity. Um so if somebody says find me a good whatever in this city or find

37:44: me a good whatever near me chat GPT is just going to look at the location that you're in and then pull some

37:50: recommendations based on that. Proximity is not a significant rank factor. Um for

37:55: Google obviously proximity is a significant rank factor. And if somebody is using the search term near me,

38:02: proximity is actually a higher rank factor than if they had just done the city search. Right? So if you run a heat

38:09: map or a local rank map for uh any business and you run it for like plumber

38:15: Chicago versus plumber near me, you will almost always see the plumber Chicago

38:20: rank map looks better, assuming that you built up enough trust and relevance and everything. uh you'll rank farther away

38:26: from the GBP location with the city search versus a near me search. Then the proximity is much more important. You

38:32: can get a near me map to turn fully green, but that just requires, you know, building up more trust and more

38:39: relevance to overcome the near me proximity factor. Is am I making sense

38:45: with that, Billy? You are. I guess what I'm thinking is is does it help you does it help get the

38:50: near me people if you put in your schema as as a frequently asked question will that help you any

38:57: put I'm not what what do you mean put near me so many searches out there now where people put in you know Mexican

39:03: restaurant near me or whatever and so then if you put that in if you put best Dallas Mexican restaurant near me in

39:10: your schema and then put it as a frequently asked question can that help you rank on the map pack for the near

39:17: in Dallas for the Mexican restaurant for example. Oh, um boy, I don't have a good answer

39:23: for that. Uh I hate guessing. Uh if I were guessing, then I would guess that

39:29: it is uh not significant just because when when the near me comes up, then we

39:36: really just need a lot more trust and a lot more relevance to grow it farther away from the GBP. And that's code. Of

39:43: course, when I say trust, what I mean is powerful links. uh hyper local links. And when I say relevance, I mean content

39:50: specifically designed to get Google to see you as more of an authority on whatever topic you're trying to rank

39:56: for. Uh thanks. Yeah. Cool. Nadem, how are you?

40:01: How's it going, Caleb? You okay? I'm I'm good. I'm good. How have you been? Yeah, good. Good, mate. Very good. Um it

40:08: was just three questions I've got today. All right. So, um first question is I've

40:14: got a GMBB account. and I've tried to verify it's not. So, real quick, real quick, Nadem, I did

40:20: make a new rule. I don't think you're here at the beginning, but we said one question per hand raise. So, I'll ask

40:25: you a question and then put your hand down and bring it up again and if we have time, brilliant. We'll get to you again. But go ahead.

40:31: All right. So, the most important question, the GMBB verification. Um, I've been not back once with it. Um, and

40:38: what it's done is it's basically telling me to submit the the video again. um

40:43: where where you have to walk around and that um what do I do? Because I know in the I know obviously in the course it

40:49: says um like give one one bit of um one bit of evidence to show that the

40:54: company's yours or whoever it or the clients um and then submit that one and

41:00: then then then submit the second one if it knocks you back again with the first one and then keep doing that. But do you

41:07: submit that in the video or is there another way of doing it?

41:12: So, no. If they're asking you to do another video, then just do another video. Uh, usually that's really good

41:19: news. Uh, so just do another video and in the second time you do the video,

41:24: try to make sure that you just show documentation like your insurance or a utility bill or license documentation.

41:31: Uh, just slowly pan over it with the camera. Uh, you can't go fast or it won't get accepted because if it's

41:37: blurry, it'll be rejected. But if you just go real slow so that they can see that the business name is on there, the

41:42: address is on there. Uh that's going to be even better than submitting it later. So yeah, uh just do the video again. Uh

41:49: and often that'll get you there. If not, what we'll usually see happen is the video will be approved. It'll list be

41:57: the GBP will be listed as verified and then it will almost immediately be suspended. Uh and that's when you would

42:03: submit a lot of that paperwork. Okay. Okay. All right, then. So, do you

42:08: reckon it more than likely it probably will get accepted or is it one of those you just who knows? Well, the good news is if it's asking

42:15: for another video, then there's no limit, right? If you get suspended and

42:20: you start appealing the suspension, you only get to do two appeals, right? And after you do two appeals, if you get

42:26: denied the second time, then you need to create another GBP. But if you're still in the video verification stage, there's

42:32: no limit. You can do that as much as you want. Just keep doing it and don't give up. even if I mean we've had clients who

42:38: had to record the damn video 30 times before it got accepted and verified. So

42:43: there's no limit to how many times you you can record the video. So when you when you say like obviously

42:49: if it gets if it gets the pill gets rejected twice and then you have to create a new G G um GBP is that like

42:56: basically creating a new email doing all of that you'd have to do with a new Google account and and everything. Yeah,

43:02: absolutely. You still can keep obviously you still can keep the company name the same is it? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So if you So if

43:07: you're doing that on your second appeal, like that's when you like every piece of documentation you have uh to to make

43:13: sure that second appeal gets accepted. Okay. Okay. And brilliant. Thank you.

43:19: Yeah, absolutely. Mark, how are you? You're muted, buddy.

43:24: Yeah, I'm very well, thank you. How are you? There you go. Good. Good. So, uh, I'm in a bit of a pickle from

43:31: the point of view that we've had a business for 22 years and it's a wheelie bin or trash can cleaning business. I've

43:38: expanded our services to pressure washing, driveways, patios, gutter

43:44: cleaning, that sort of thing. And when I watched your videos about how you can add all these different categories and

43:50: services to your GB uh, GBP, I've done that. And obviously later in your call

43:57: she said be careful as to how many you add at one time. So I added 11 services

44:02: to the GBP and I've also added uh amended the the landing page from the

44:10: GPP with all the 11 services on. I've published 11 new pages with each service

44:17: and I've got 110 pages scheduled with the support and

44:22: content of each of those services. So they had scheduled over the next 10 days. I just need to know what do I need

44:29: to rain back for a bit of context. The site is 15 years 15 years old. It's got

44:36: 581 index pages. So and um yeah I mean but I've only been

44:43: posting generally around about 10 to 20 posts a month. Yeah. So I wouldn't worry too much about

44:50: the volume that you're doing. Like usually we'll start to worry about volume. If you're doing like dozens and

44:55: dozens, hundreds of posts a month, that's problematic. Uh but you know, 10

45:01: 15 a month is not terribly concerning. Um so with the changes that you're

45:07: talking about, that sounds great. Um, the first thing that I would suggest

45:12: that you make sure you do a local rank map and the better your current position is, the less I would touch your existing

45:20: landing page, right? If if your current position is just 20 plus everywhere, then do whatever the hell you want.

45:26: You'll be fine. Uh, but if you're actually ranking decently well and then you come in and make dramatic changes to

45:31: the landing page, you can find yourself losing the rank that you do have. So, if you're ranking reasonably well or even

45:37: like halfway reasonably well, we'll generally add exist add content to the landing page and not delete entirely.

45:45: Um, and you mentioned 11 services. That's a lot to link to from the GBP landing page. We'll usually not link to

45:52: more than like five or six different things. usually the secondary categories and then maybe two or three services

45:58: that we care a lot about will link to from that GVP landing page uh with those

46:03: little blurbs of of text and everything. Uh and yeah, the other thing like it it might be tough to get indexed uh if you

46:10: suddenly increase the produ uh publication volume that high. So that's one of the reasons to look at like a PBN

46:17: link or some other type of external link to all the content you're creating to get Google to actually index it. or you

46:24: could use a service that I dropped before the index me now something like that. Yes. So answer to that question then I'm

46:31: currently 1.3 for our core services uh for our call cleaning uh which was wheelie bin and commercial bin cleaning.

46:37: Um I'm ranking like 1.3 and a uh 10 mile radius. However, the

46:44: Yeah, I mean that's great, right? So I I would not change very much about that. You're if you're already ranked 1.3 and

46:49: 10 miles that's Yeah. Don't don't touch it much. What about the pressure cleaning though where obviously all the

46:55: pressure washing where these are new services that we have been doing I just haven't had them on the yeah so like so then add it to your uh

47:02: add a section at the bottom of your landing page that talks about pressure washing and then link to a more detailed

47:08: page that you talk a lot more about the pressure washing services uh and pay attention we have seen it happen where

47:15: if you add a category that Google doesn't think is relevant and you add that category and then link to it from

47:21: your landing page, we've seen uh rank positions drop for the primary category.

47:28: So, just watch your local rank maps and if you do see a significant drop, then

47:34: just delete it from your GBP landing page and put it in the navbar or something uh and and uh then build it

47:39: from the navbar. Okay, just a yes or no question. On the keywords that you put in the the rank

47:46: map, do you put the location or just literally the keyword? The city name.

47:52: City name as well. Right. Okay. Main service city name. That's what we track normally. Kyle, how are you doing?

47:58: Hey man, uh quick question for you on uh closebot.ai. Uh you mentioned a while ago that you

48:04: were experimenting with that for lead genen. I was curious if you uh had any success with that, if you're still working on that.

48:10: Still playing with it. The plan is here in August. I know it's August 7th. Um,

48:16: this trip to Austin delayed me a bit. I'm trying to So, for the past couple of

48:21: months, or for the past month or so, I basically been like one YouTube video recorded ahead of time, which is

48:27: terrible. I hate that. Uh, it's like the Sisphus rock thing, you know what I mean? Um,

48:33: so I'm trying to get ahead on YouTube videos now that the kids are back in school and everything. Once that

48:39: happens, uh my plan was to start my um new agency

48:45: uh series where basically I'll I'm going to build an agency uh on camera to 10K a

48:51: month and my goal is to do it in 3 months with no sales calls. Uh so one of

48:56: the core areas that I was one of the core tools I was going to use to do that was closebot. Uh now what's interesting

49:03: is it's been a few months and since then uh high level has added as native

49:09: features a lot of the features that close bot had that made it so uniquely

49:14: good at collecting the right information uh as a chatbot. So all that stuff is

49:19: now uh in high level. So I might not use closebot. I might just uh do the highle

49:25: thing. Um, still like I said, I haven't had a chance to think about that like I'd like to. Mainly because

49:33: Yeah. I mean, I spent I was gallivanting in Austin this week instead of recording YouTube videos.

49:39: Man, so irresponsible of you, right? No, man. All good. I appreciate the

49:45: update. I'm personally looking at uh Chat GPT just launched the agents feature a couple of weeks ago. I don't

49:51: know if everyone's tracking that uh which is different from just the content generation. and I'm really interested in

49:56: using that for lead genen as well. So, my brain's spinning on this topic. Uh, looking forward an update and I'll share some stuff on my end if I have it.

50:03: Perfect. Awesome. So, let's see. Uh, Michelle asks to clarify what Marco was saying was changing the homepage. If you

50:08: don't change the content, but just the layout, can this drop the ranking? Yes. Um, if you change anything, it can drop

50:14: the ranking. And I know that seems hard to believe, but we've had clients who had WordPress websites and their

50:21: marketing company was holding them hostage, wouldn't give them their website back. So, we rebuilt the exact

50:27: same website with the exact same format, the exact same content, the exact same

50:32: images, and we moved the or and it was the same domain. So, we just moved a

50:38: hosting company and then connected it to their same exact domain. and we thought everything was exactly the same and they

50:44: lost rank position. Uh just moving the host company was enough to to do it. So

50:50: if you're ranking well, like just change as little as possible. Uh and if your

50:56: client is just like, man, this page is so ugly. I really want a new designed website so it looks fun and slick. Then

51:02: just cool. Uh but if you change the design, you're going to lose ranking. And if you're okay with that, then knock

51:08: yourself out, right? I've seen so many examples of relatively small changes

51:14: just plummeting rank position. Google does not like change. Uh how long did it take? I think it took us 3 months to

51:21: recover. Um so yeah, it was not insignificant. It wasn't like it took a

51:26: week to come back. It took months to come back. Um for using high level, so

51:32: regardless. Okay. So I was planning on using high level. Even if I use Closebot, it would be Closebot

51:38: integrated with High Level. Uh I would love to use Lead Snap because Lead Snap has a CRM. Uh so I'm I've been pushing

51:45: Patrick really hard to see if you would let me integrate Closebot into Lead Snap, then I could potentially do that.

51:52: But uh Okay, cool. What measures did it take? Just more content. Just continue to produce the content, build up that

51:57: topical relevance. Uh I think we might have joined another chamber. Um it was a

52:02: little bit farther away. I think the one we joined was like 60 mi away, but we'd already joined all the nearby ones. Uh

52:08: so basically just more of the same stuff that we always do. Uh but you know, you kind of eventually start to run out of

52:14: stuff when you're in, you know, rank super well. Uh but anyway, yeah, it's, you know, just

52:21: don't change things. Uh that that was like if you're ranking really well and you're happy with your primary category

52:27: and you think, man, this other category might be a little bit better, don't change. just just it's fine. You know,

52:34: if you're ranking well, you're good. Okay. Uh like Mr. McDaniel Brian is is nodding there like yeah, just changing

52:41: will almost always result in losing rank. So even uh when we're just adding to the GBP content, we don't see rank

52:48: drops, but that's like we'll add 200 words at the bottom and then you know

52:54: the next month we might add another 200 words below that. So, relatively stuff like that. We'll just add a little bit,

53:00: add a little bit, that hasn't had an impact. Uh, I did have a client, he was

53:06: um it was a dental office brokerage, right? So, they got, you know, like

53:11: 2,000 hits a month of traffic and they were thrilled with it because every lead was worth like 50 grand uh because it

53:18: was a business brokerage for dental offices. So, they they were getting like

53:23: 2,000 hits a month, something like that. We brought it up from zero over like a year and a half. They're a long-term

53:29: client and they wanted a complete redesign. I said, "Please don't." And they said, "No, we're going to keep the

53:34: content the same. We're going to keep the URLs the same." They did a complete redesign. A week after they launched the

53:40: new site, their monthly traffic went from 2,000 to like 80. Um, it was just

53:45: like up and to the right, up and to the right, and boom. Like, it was just gone. Uh, Google doesn't like change is the

53:52: moral. Jay, what you got, man? You're muted.

53:57: Gotta get that speaker back on. There you go. Something that's kind of bugging me, but

54:02: I don't know how if there's anything you can do about it. Looking at my map ranks, my

54:10: impressions is the only word I can come up with has dropped off severely um over

54:16: the last three months. Is that something to do with what I'm doing on the website or is that something?

54:23: So, where are you seeing the impressions? Uh, well, it should say Google search is

54:29: what it's actually on. And I was looking at one of my like map ranking pages.

54:34: I'm still So, are you looking at the in the impressions on Google Search Console?

54:39: Yes. Okay. I would not worry about that even a little bit.

54:45: Okay. Um, okay. So the reason why uh I can I I can't explain uh interactions with your

54:51: Google maps listing with your GBP interactions with it, clicks to it, views of it, none of that is counted in

54:58: the Google search console. Um so your Google search console uh the definition

55:04: of impressions in the Google search console what that means is if your

55:10: organic website if your organic result was loaded then Google will count it as

55:16: an impression the person doesn't need to scroll down and see it right so if you're ranked in position seven on a

55:22: local search no one is going to scroll down and search it right everyone is going to choose one of the GBPs maybe

55:27: the first or second organic listing but If you're in position seven, Google will count that as an impression, right? Even

55:35: if nobody scrolls down to see it. Yeah. So, what we often will see when we're working on an SEO campaign, we'll see

55:41: the number of index keywords spike up and then eventually we'll see the number of impressions spike up. Those happen

55:48: long before the actual clicks do. And for a local business, there's very few organic clicks that

55:54: we're trying to get anyway. We're trying to get the GBP ranked. we're trying to get interactions with the GBP. Uh click

56:01: clicking on the website to to or clicking on the website button, clicking on the call button, anything like that.

56:07: Um and none of that is countered in the search console. The search console, we use it for some things in local, but

56:14: honestly, uh the search console is not nearly as valuable for local SEO as it

56:20: is for non-local. Uh usually for local SEO, the main thing

56:25: I'm doing in the search console is pulling up the indexing report uh not

56:30: looking at any of the performance metrics because frankly I don't care about how my site is doing organically

56:36: if it's a local site. Okay. Uh weirdly, and I think this is very

56:41: weird because I just said, right, anything from the GBP doesn't count in the search console. But if you're if

56:47: you're in the AI overview, clicks from the AI overview will count in the Google

56:52: search console. Okay. Now, as of yet, I have not seen any search

56:58: where the AI overview and the map results show up at the same time. It's almost always one or the other.

57:04: Yeah, I say almost always. Basically, one or the other. Uh that I'm sure will change.

57:10: Uh, and we can get an AI overview to show up for a local search. Right? If

57:17: you type in plumber Chicago, you're going to get a map results. If you type in please recommend a plumber in

57:23: Chicago, you won't get a map. You're going to get an AI overview that's going to recommend plumbers in Chicago. And

57:30: what's wild about that? What is so wild about that? Uh, if you look at I I can

57:37: show you. I actually I literally have let let me just show you. This is just I I think this is insane. Okay, so here's

57:44: I'm So I type in, can you recommend a good plumber? And there's no map, right? No map, but we have an AI overview. And

57:50: the AI overview is recommending power plumbing, sound plumbing, and Excel plumbing. This is Google's AI overview

57:58: for a conversational local search. Right now, what h if I type in plumber Chicago, I get my map. No AI overview.

58:07: None of these are the businesses that the AI overview recommended. So, Google

58:13: Map is recommending three completely different businesses than the AI overview and they're both showing up on

58:20: Google, which I just think is batshit. It's just insane. Like, why

58:26: isn't it not the same businesses? They're both Google. It's just a sign, of course, that the AI is looking for

58:33: something different than what the map is looking for. Okay, still wild. Uh, and I

58:40: had that pulled up and ready because I'm about to record another YouTube video where I talk about that in more detail.

58:46: Uh, let's see. Michelle asked, "Is the rank if the ranking is one, two, or three in maps, leave it alone? Four plus

58:52: is okay." Okay, so no. Right. So one, two, or three would be don't touch anything, right? because if you're one,

58:58: two, and three, then you're visible. And there's essentially no difference if you're ranked number one or number three. Uh there's almost no CTR

59:06: difference whatsoever. Once you're in the top three, your number of calls, the amount of traffic you get is going to be

59:12: based on your review quality and quantity, not whether you're in the first or the third position. So the

59:17: problem is, say you're ranked number four everywhere. And you're probably not. If your average rank on a local

59:23: rank map is four, you're probably ranked one, two, or three for a third of the map and then it slowly drops to 6,

59:30: seven, eight as you get farther and farther from the location. So, if you update something dramatic and your

59:36: average rank is number four, you could then see that your average rank drops to 10 or 11, right? So, one of the things

59:43: that I like about Lead Snap a lot, and I can pull it up and show you guys because I was just playing around with I was

59:49: just showing a client of mine why I like this so much. And this is stuff that

59:54: local dominator didn't have. So, I'm just going to pull up a a recent heat map I did.

1:00:01: Automate GBP heat map history. I'm going to share screen as soon as I get there.

1:00:11: have a drink while it's loading. Oh, here we go. This guy's not a client, so I can happily share his data and not be

1:00:17: afraid of of anything. Not that you guys would do anything. It's not like I'm on YouTube. Gh. All right. I did make a

1:00:24: mistake once long ago of showing one of my clients on YouTube and then they started complaining about how many

1:00:29: unsolicited calls they were getting about how I was terrible at SEO. So, yeah, I don't show clients on YouTube

1:00:34: anymore, but anyway, you guys won't do that. This guy isn't a client anyway. Okay, so this is why I like lead snap

1:00:40: over local dominator even just for these heat maps. Um, and what I really like, let me make this a little bigger. What I

1:00:46: like about it is that it's so Hinton is the one that I ran the heat map for and this is Hinton's heat map. Assuming this

1:00:53: is a different city with that kind of crazy drop off, but what I like about this is it shows you the average rank uh

1:01:00: and the percentage that you're in the top three. And I care a lot more about this percentage in the top three, right?

1:01:06: This is the core metric that I care about uh is what percentage of the area

1:01:11: is in the top three. Right? So this guy obviously he's doing really well. 40% he's number one. So we can potentially,

1:01:17: you know, maybe do a little bit better, but he's doing really well. So if I'm looking at something like this where the

1:01:23: number one guy is 40% and then we drop off pretty quick, this is a sign that there's not a lot of competition here,

1:01:30: right? If I look at another heat map, uh I just ran it. This is one in Orlando.

1:01:36: This guy. So, if I'm looking at a heat map that looks like this,

1:01:48: well, maybe it wasn't Orlando. Anyway, whatever it was, there's another heat

1:01:54: map I was looking at. Oh, no. It was west um it was west something or other.

1:02:02: See if I could find it. It was filter by

1:02:07: and it was west. What the hell is their location? You guys don't know, do you? Let me try

1:02:12: this one. West Palm Beach. This might have been the one. Yes, this is the one. Okay, so if I pull up a heat map, and

1:02:20: this is stuff that local dominator doesn't give you, but if I pull up, he calls it a heat map. If I call up a pull

1:02:25: up this local uh rank map, obviously they're terrible. Uh but that's not the important thing. The important thing is,

1:02:31: right, how many spots are there in the top three, right? There's obviously three. There are three spots in the top three. Number one is 91% of this area is

1:02:39: in the top three. Okay, this is this is bad news. Uh this is a really well-established business. This guy's

1:02:46: going to be really hard to outrank. Number two is 84%. This guy's also going to be really hard

1:02:52: to outrank. He's really well established. Uh yeah, here here's his map and he's got some random twelves.

1:02:58: Otherwise, he looks golden. Here's this guy's map and he looks fabulous, right?

1:03:03: So, if I'm trying to rank for this keyword in West Palm Beach, I know it's going to be crazy competitive because

1:03:09: there's basically only one spot that I can reasonably go after. So, I'm going to be pretty nervous telling this client

1:03:16: that we're going to get results quickly just because of what I see on this rank map. So, this is one of the reasons that

1:03:22: I think lead snap is so much better at um these local rank maps than local

1:03:27: dominator because I get to see data like this and I can just easily click and pull it up and compare. And that was the

1:03:34: conversation I was having with this particular client earlier today. I was just like, man, I don't know what your

1:03:39: budget is, but outranking these two guys is really not doable, which means you're playing for number three. It's it's

1:03:46: competitive. It's going to be hard. Um, so anyway, what question did you ask and how did I get off of that? Oh, yeah. So,

1:03:53: just just keep in mind whatever your local rank make whatever your local rank map

1:03:59: looks like, the more you change, the more likely you are to find it all go to 20 plus. Um, so really the answer is

1:04:06: don't update the design ever. Uh, one of my clients has a website that we designed 10 years ago. It's ugly. It's

1:04:14: stupid. It converts. It's fine. Um,

1:04:19: yeah. Okay, that's Dale. He's saying the same thing. Honestly, in my experience, the best converting local websites are

1:04:25: ones that look like they're 10 years old, right? A brand new shiny local website won't convert as well as a site

1:04:32: that looks like it's 10 years old. Yeah. So, it's not so much extra moves

1:04:38: that we would need to do, Michelle. It's mainly just that we would have to do more, right? So, we need more topical

1:04:43: relevance. We need to build more trust. we need to build more uh more of those powerful links in order to get into the

1:04:51: top three cuz yeah there's only one spot usually in the top three there's three spots and if you look at like the other

1:04:58: ones I was showing where 30 40% in the top three no problem but 90% and 85%

1:05:05: yeah we're playing for the third third place basically um so really the way

1:05:11: that we judge competitiveness is I I would look at those top two, maybe pull

1:05:17: like three, four, and five, get an idea how big are their websites, how many total URLs are indexed, uh, compare that

1:05:23: to the client, and that just gives me a rough idea of how much content I might

1:05:28: need to go and do it. I say rough because it really just is rough. Um,

1:05:34: time frame would be based on their budget, right? So, uh, if I said, "Hey,

1:05:39: it looks like we need to do a hundred pages, uh, of content in order to be

1:05:45: competitive with some of the top players," then my, uh, retail price for

1:05:51: content, I charge $300 a page. So, if I said, "Hey, I think I need 100 pages." I

1:05:56: charge $300 a page. My actual cost is a little bit less than $100 a page. So,

1:06:02: I'm I'm running about a 70% gross margin. Uh, I don't use Screaming Frog

1:06:07: to pull it, Michelle. Uh, good question, Jay. I find the number by doing a site search. So, let me show you. I'll just

1:06:14: do it real quick. Um, so if I'm looking at this, uh, I I So, I'm going to pull up the website.

1:06:21: I'm going to pull up the website. And this is another cool thing, right? Just from from right here, I can pull up the

1:06:28: websites. And then the reason I don't use um screaming frog is because for

1:06:36: this type of analysis, screaming frog is going to give me the indexable URLs. How

1:06:43: many URLs Google could potentially index and I don't care about that, right? They could have 10,000 crappy pages generated

1:06:50: by AI that Google will never index. Um but I want to see this. So this is 330

1:06:57: results from my site search. So that tells me this particular domain has 330 indexed pages. This guy has 140 and this

1:07:05: is the number three player 240. So they don't know what they're doing and this guy's 112. So a client who came to me

1:07:12: and this was their competition. If he had like 20 pages indexed, which is pretty common, uh then I'd say we need

1:07:20: 100 150 more pages of content. Um, my cost, like I mentioned, is a little bit

1:07:26: less than 100 bucks per page. Figure out what your costs are, what you want your gross margin to be. Uh, but I charge uh

1:07:33: $300 a page. So, if we wanted 150 pages at $300 a page, that's $45,000. So, then

1:07:39: the question is, okay, Mr. Client, what is your timeline? If you want to get this done in one month, sure, we'll bang

1:07:45: it out in one month. I mean, that might be a little tough. I don't think I'd have the resources to do that straight away, but most clients don't have

1:07:51: $45,000 to spend. Um, but if they said, "Hey, what's a more reasonable budget?" Like, well, would you be okay with the

1:07:57: 12-month timeline? That would be $4,000 a month, $3750. No, that's too long. You

1:08:03: want a six-month timeline? Okay, that would be $7,500 a month. Because, right, if we do $7,500 times 6 months, that's

1:08:10: $45,000. So, it's the total scope that I'm looking at. What how many total pages do I need to build? do I need to

1:08:17: link to? Do I need to do the internal linking? Do I need to do all the stuff that we got to do? Uh, and then how many

1:08:23: months does the client want to wait basically? Um, and yeah, that's how we that's how we price things. All right,

1:08:30: Davidid, how are you again? Hey, I'm still good, Kar. Thank you.

1:08:36: And funny because my question was the follow up following this this part but

1:08:41: let's once you complete that how do you keep going with to to charge the clients

1:08:46: and do you do separate let's say the guy who is going to say I'm going to do it in 3 months and the one who is going to

1:08:53: say I'm going to do in 12 months that says something about his budget and how do you keep going the the engagement and

1:08:59: how do you keep this client and how do you charge him I'll have a pay please thank you great So, that's basically how we would

1:09:06: start is by saying, "Okay, it's going to be this price for this many months, and then we'll try we'll get you ranked."

1:09:11: Um, I'll usually give them a confidence interval. So, that one that I was looking looking at just now was an HVAC

1:09:18: contractor and we're in August. So, you know, this season is gone. Uh, and he's

1:09:23: in South Florida, so he only really cares about next summer. So, he's just like, I want to be in the top three uh

1:09:30: by like next spring, right? And I'll be like, okay, so based on those

1:09:36: competitors, uh, and he has a particular he has a powerful site and all of this stuff. It's a multilocation. So I could

1:09:42: say, you know, about 80% confidence that we will have 50% of your map in the top

1:09:48: three by February if we spend $45,000 and generate 150 pages. So that is just

1:09:56: because I've done this enough. But you can see I'm sort of grabbing a bunch of numbers and then estimating high and

1:10:03: then giving it a confidence interval. Uh for a lower competitive it's obviously easier to do. And then so once we get

1:10:10: closer to February, uh hopefully we're seeing that percentage top three get closer and closer to 50%. Uh if we're

1:10:17: not, then I uh might just go ahead and sacrifice margin and increase the publishing velocity to hit the goal that

1:10:24: I said I wanted to hit. uh even if that sacrifices my margin. If I said, you

1:10:30: know, hey, 80% chance that we're going to be 50% in the top three and we got nothing in the top three and it's

1:10:35: January, well, I mean, then I'm probably just not going to profit from that client for a couple of months and just

1:10:41: hit it really hard to try to hit that goal that I said we could do. Uh even though I did only say an 80% confidence,

1:10:49: uh if we hit that right, then the conversation with the client is a is a

1:10:54: much more comfortable one. And it's just like, okay, so what do you want to do next? Right? We hit the 50% in the top

1:11:00: three. Do you want to grow that uh more and more to build more trust o overcome

1:11:05: that proximity decline? Uh do you want to start another another GBP location and we can start hitting that second GBP

1:11:12: location or third or fourth, whatever number it is, or do we want to just reduce the budget? Right? So, because I

1:11:18: price relatively high, $300 an article, uh, 70% gross margin or so, once we hit

1:11:25: the point where they are ranked pretty well, if I say, "Hey, if if you're happy with that, you're happy with the lead

1:11:31: volume, uh, and we really just want to keep what we have, then let's bring the

1:11:37: publishing velocity down, maybe go to 5 to 10 a month. That's usually enough to keep things where they are. And then

1:11:43: instead of $4,000 or $7,000 a month, if we're doing five articles a month, it's

1:11:48: $1,500 a month. And then we can just keep doing that and publishing that content, sourcing those links, uh, and,

1:11:54: you know, keep the rank map looking like it does. But yeah, I don't know. Is that helpful?

1:12:00: Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. So in in um you you are going to tell him that in order to protect this ranking, you need to

1:12:08: keep going to produce content, right? 100%. And that's true in like That's true. this.

1:12:13: Yeah, it's absolutely true. Especially like HVAC in South Florida, which is a very competitive space for HVAC, right?

1:12:20: You if you've ever been in South Florida, you can't throw a rock without hitting an HVAC technician. Uh it's a

1:12:25: very competitive space for obvious reasons. Um so yeah, definitely in a space like that. And what we're doing in

1:12:31: those sort of maintenance is every month we're basically it's the same thing, just a lower volume, right? Every month

1:12:36: we're looking at the rank map. We're looking for like fours and fives and then we're going to produce geographic

1:12:42: content where those fours and fives are to try to turn them back to three. And most months we're going to, you know, as

1:12:49: many threes will turn to fours as will turn back the other way. But you know what? We're in maintenance mode, so that's what we would expect to happen.

1:12:56: Okay. Thank you. Perfect. Uh, all right. And what gets

1:13:02: the most bang with SEO? New pages and more content or more backlinks? Okay, good question. We never post additional

1:13:08: content without a link to it. So every new page has a PBN. Um, yeah. So that's

1:13:14: it. Every new page has a PBN. And so what we would do to give that extra push is just more content, right? So my plan

1:13:21: was 150 over 6 months. Uh, let's just pretend. So that's what 25 a month. But

1:13:28: if if I'm in January and I'm not seeing the progress I need, maybe I go to publishing 50 in January. or maybe I

1:13:34: lose my mind and I publish 75 in January just to make sure I hit the commitment that I told him. Uh, but every single

1:13:41: one of those, we're going to publish the content. We're going to use images on the content. We're going to use callouts. We're going to format it well

1:13:46: so there's no blocks of text. We're going to do the internal linking. We're going to source a PBN. On top of that,

1:13:52: uh, especially in a place like South Florida, we're going to go join a bunch of chambers of commerce, right? We're

1:13:58: going to basically join every chamber of commerce within 40 or 50 miles. uh just knowing how competitive that is, it's

1:14:03: going to be worth it. Uh each chamber is like a few hundred bucks per year. They're not super expensive for

1:14:09: engagements of this size, especially uh like I have a PI uh attorney client and

1:14:15: he's a member of like 16 chambers of commerce. Basically, every chamber within 75 miles we joined. But yeah, you

1:14:22: know, he's a PI attorney, so he pays enough per month that it's a negligible cost. uh it sucks when the annual

1:14:29: renewals come up, but other than that, it's a negligible cost over the total year of of him as a client, which is

1:14:35: another reason I I price so quote unquote high. I keep my gross margins high because I don't charge for

1:14:41: development time. Uh I don't nickel and dime. I don't charge for a lot of these sponsorships or chamber of commerce. We

1:14:47: just absorb a lot of those costs. Um because, you know, there are a few things that people hate more than being

1:14:52: nickel and dimed. Um Oh, and that was your follow-up question. Yeah, I just absorb them. Um, so once they're ranked,

1:14:59: my profit margin gets a lot better. Uh, before they're actually ranked, my my gross is close to or a little bit more

1:15:06: than 70, but my like net margin is probably in the 40 to 50% range because

1:15:12: we're doing thing like we're getting the citations. Uh, we're running a bunch of heat maps. Uh, you know, we're doing all

1:15:17: these things that we're not charging for. We have uh the obviously the development time to create the pages is

1:15:23: included in my $100 cost, but a lot of websites you look at them and they have

1:15:29: 300 pages of crap. So, you got to go through that crap, you got to delete, you got to merge, you got to um you

1:15:36: know, just fix their website. Uh especially in a more competitive space like you know HVAC in South Florida. Um

1:15:45: so, and all of that stuff we usually don't charge for. or we'll just have the developer do it. It'll be, you know, my

1:15:51: developer is $15 an hour. So, if it takes him 20 hours to do, which is a long time, it'll cost me 300 bucks. So,

1:15:58: I'll just um I'll just absorb that. Uh and if the client leaves, then I don't renew, right? The renewal comes up the

1:16:05: next year and I just don't because they're not a client anymore. So then yeah, they would lose that membership,

1:16:11: they'd lose that link and losing a chamber of commerce link. Uh we almost always see a rank map decline when that

1:16:18: happens. Guy, what's going on? Oh, just a follow-up question. uh

1:16:25: in some of your past uh roundts or or maybe it's one of the lessons in the

1:16:32: um in the coursework, but you had talked about um you had done some cold email or you

1:16:40: or you're looking into it. I wasn't sure if you if you have done that and if so, what kind of email sequences do you use

1:16:47: um for cold outreach? Yeah, that's a good question. So, I I was putting a lesson together uh

1:16:53: specific to cold email and I was playing around with it. Sent some cold email. Uh

1:16:58: used a tool that Derek had mentioned. He's not here anymore. He he was here. Used a tool that Derek had mentioned. Um

1:17:05: and I mean it was okay. I was getting maybe like a two or 3% response rate.

1:17:12: Oh, Derek is here. Excellent. Send Spark. That is the tool. Thank you, Derek. Oh, there you are in the lower

1:17:17: right. You you were up on top. top. I guess your hand was up, you put it down. Anyway, so we're using Send Spark. We're

1:17:22: getting like a 2 or 3% response rate, which which is fine. I mean, it wasn't terrible. Um, but what I was looking at

1:17:30: doing that for was part of this, you know, let me get to 10K in 3 months. Uh, and frankly, like uh 2% response rate

1:17:38: with like 10 or 15 emails a day, I wasn't going to be able to get there fast enough uh for that series to be a

1:17:46: success. Uh so the plan is now to basically use paid ads. Um uh a

1:17:52: combination of Google ads and Facebook ads. And like I said, like I'm I'm not

1:17:58: going to create a classroom for it. Maybe at some point I will, but the intent for now is just to literally

1:18:03: build everything on camera. Um I'll possibly even drop a Zoom link if you guys want to join and and we can all do

1:18:09: it together uh and see how it goes. Cuz the thing is uh Facebook ads and YouTube

1:18:14: ads you can get leads so inexpensively uh even local business leads that it's

1:18:21: just like I mean unless you just don't have the money to pay for that uh

1:18:27: because right Senspark isn't free uh I think it was like 200 bucks a month for

1:18:33: the version of Sensspark that can integrate with high level and then you need high level and then uh closebot and

1:18:40: it was very quickly being like, "Okay, well, I'm going to spend a,000 or $2,000 a month on all these tools cuz then you

1:18:47: need a tool to warm up your emails and you need this other tool to do this and blah blah blah." And it's just like,

1:18:52: "Well, I'd rather just spend like 10 bucks a day on Facebook ads. That's $3,000 a month and then I'll get two or

1:18:59: three leads a day. That's going to be more than what I'm getting for my cold email."

1:19:05: Gotcha. $10. $10 a day or $100 a day for Facebook ads? Uh 10 bucks a day is Oh,

1:19:11: you're right. 10 bucks a day is $300 a month. So yeah, I could run $10 a day or I could buy SS Spark. I I missed an

1:19:17: order of magnitude. Yeah, if I'm spending three grand, then that's $100 a day. You're right. Um, so yeah, I mean,

1:19:24: and with 10 or $20, like $20 a day is usually what we run, but I mean, $20 a

1:19:29: day, uh, if your landing page is good and your, uh, yeah, senders and, but if

1:19:36: your landing page is good, if your offer is good, uh, both on YouTube ads and

1:19:41: Facebook ads, you can generate leads for $3 a piece or less, right? So, uh, so if

1:19:49: you're running $20 a day, I mean, you're getting four or five leads a day, right?

1:19:54: And I mean, that's a lot of leads. And once you get that lead, right, it's four or five a day. Now, you can just

1:20:00: manually do the work, right? You can just record a Loom video uh because it should take two or three minutes and

1:20:06: there's only a handful of them of a day and your response rate is going to be much higher because they've already expressed an interest. So, it's really

1:20:12: like, do I want to spend all of this effort on cold email uh or do I just

1:20:18: want to run ads and then do like a warm email type approach? Um, so anyway, that

1:20:24: it just like the the paid ads are so freaking effective that um it's really

1:20:29: hard to justify spending a bunch of money on all these other tools if I can just run ads and get a similar number of

1:20:37: total leads a day as I'm getting with all the tools. Now, don't get me wrong, like I know SendSpark has very high

1:20:43: usage limits. So, I could probably be sending 50 100 emails a day instead of

1:20:48: 15, but then I need multiple emails and it just starts to become a mess to

1:20:54: handle. And I'm really just looking at I've seen, you know, like campaigns in order to sign volume

1:21:02: clients, you know, they recommend you doing like 500 to a,000,

1:21:07: right? No, I know. Exactly. With one email address. So you're going

1:21:12: to need a bunch of Oh, no. Yeah. You have to warm up. Yeah. You got to warm up 50. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. And And then you got to

1:21:19: monitor all these email addresses and so that like I'm obviously not going to do that. Dear God. Like how boring would

1:21:25: that be? I got YouTube videos to record for Christ's sake. So now I got to hire someone to man to like monitor my 50

1:21:31: email accounts and switch out to other email accounts when the response rate gets too low. I mean it all just be like

1:21:37: yes I agree can be done but in my opinion just running ads is easier than

1:21:43: um than that. Uh cool. All right Nadem how are you again? What's going on?

1:21:49: Yeah all good mate. Um okay so it's it's probably a stupid question but so clean

1:21:54: creating a website on go high level um the call to action. Can I have the same

1:22:00: image of say the business owner in the call to action on a global setting on every URL cuz it will come up as

1:22:06: duplicate cont um duplicate image. Can that be done? No. So if it's your website then uh it's

1:22:12: not that big of a deal but I don't know why you would want an image of the business owner on every single URL.

1:22:18: So um it's only in the call to action bit. Oh I wouldn't worry about that. Yeah. I

1:22:23: mean it's all on your domain. So it's so when we talk about like duplicate image issues, usually what we mean is that

1:22:30: you've gone and you bought a bunch of stock photos and you've put stock photos on your website. Google knows they're

1:22:36: stock photos, right? It has the reverse image search. So it can see that these are all stock photos and stock photos

1:22:42: don't work well to rank. So don't use stock photos. AI generated photos are easier to and cheaper anyway than stock

1:22:48: photos. So just use AI to generate. But yeah, if it's a business owner as part of the call to action, I would not worry about using the same image everywhere.

1:22:56: What about then I'm only asking this because of what you just said. What about say for instance if they add an

1:23:02: image about their work? Could you use that on separate pages or would that come up as duplicate um duplicate image?

1:23:10: So there's there is a tool that will basically um god I wish I could remember

1:23:15: what the hell the tool is called. Maybe somebody here knows what it is. Somebody was just showing it to me. Uh there's a

1:23:21: tool that basically allows you to give the tool an image and then change like

1:23:27: oh, you know, change the person's ethnicity, change their hair color,

1:23:32: change their positioning, change what they're doing. So you can take one image and then use AI to generate a whole

1:23:38: bunch of similar images and use them throughout. I would usually I'd want to

1:23:43: use unique images on every page. Uh, but you know, an image of the business owner by the call to action, that doesn't give

1:23:50: me a lot of heart heartburn. I I would have no issue doing that. But I wouldn't want to use like the same four or five

1:23:56: images across the entire domain. Most of the time, I'm going to use unique images. Uh, and

1:24:03: in my experience, the easiest, fastest way to do that, I know some other people that have used some fabulous tools and

1:24:09: they've liked it. Again, I'm super lazy. Usually, I'll just find someone on Fiverr to generate a thousand AI images

1:24:15: for me. I'll send them a couple of real ones and like, give me a thousand images that look like this, and then I have all

1:24:21: the images I could ever use uh for that client or for that service type. Yeah.

1:24:26: How much does How much does that cost for a,000 images? I think it was like $30.

1:24:31: Oh, okay. All right. Brilliant. Yeah. Yeah. I appreciate it, Jay. I do have a back end here coming up. I'll try

1:24:37: to get to it. Uh, great question, Michelle, about the YouTube channel. So, I've been doing a weekly YouTube video

1:24:43: since January of 2024. So, we're at about 20 months of doing a weekly video.

1:24:50: My editor costs me between 3 and $4,000 a month. Uh, again, I'm super lazy, so I

1:24:57: don't edit my own videos. Uh, cuz that sounds insane. So, it was probably 10 to

1:25:04: 12 months before my YouTube channel was breaking even on what I was paying the editor. Um, and it was probably 6 months

1:25:12: before anyone watched a single video other than my editor, uh, who was obviously watching every single one. Um,

1:25:20: but since about March of this year, so in the last 5 months, uh, it has started

1:25:25: to do a lot better and, um, the agency is growing pretty well. Almost all of my

1:25:30: leads are now coming in from the YouTube channel. Uh, which, you know, obviously when I talk about doing this challenge,

1:25:36: I'm not going to use leads from the YouTube channel. Uh but a lot of the leads are coming in from the YouTube channel. But yeah, so great move. Uh if

1:25:43: anyone is thinking about it, would highly recommend it. Just keep in mind again, it took me about a year of doing

1:25:50: this weekly before it really uh started to pay off and I was paying three or $4,000 a month for video editing for

1:25:57: that entire year. There are few things that you can do worse than start a YouTube channel and after 6 months stop

1:26:05: uh because 6 months isn't enough time. So the way to think about YouTube real quick, the domain rating, right? How

1:26:11: powerful the overall domain is. The equivalent metric for YouTube is your channel's watch time, total watch time,

1:26:18: right? So the more watch time you build up, the more likely goo YouTube is to recommend your video on its home screen

1:26:25: or something like that. So it takes a long time of building up watch time, building up watch time, unless you get

1:26:31: super lucky and come up and do a viral video, which I have yet to do. Um but yeah, anyway, cool. Mark, what's up?

1:26:40: Uh very quickly, I know you're tight on time now. It's just 2 minutes. I've got 40 um exact match domains on all with

1:26:49: name chief just across a couple of um hosts. Would I be able to use them as my

1:26:56: own PBN network? They're all they've all got about 50 index pages on each one.

1:27:02: Yes, absolutely. So I believe I have do I I can't remember if I have it or not. So I I might have a lesson on how to

1:27:09: build a PBN. Um it is non-trivial to build a PBN. The biggest challenge with

1:27:15: it is you have to do it in such a way that Google doesn't see a footprint, right? If Google sees a footprint, then

1:27:22: it will just de-index your entire PBN. So what that means is the hosting accounts need to be unique. You can't

1:27:29: put all 40 of them on the same host hosting account because then the C-class IP addresses will be the same. Google

1:27:35: will see they're related to one another and de-index the whole thing. Uh so the answer is yes, but you have to build it

1:27:42: in such a way that there's no visible footprint that Google can discover. So they all need to be hosted uniquely.

1:27:48: They need to be registered at a variety of different registars, you know. So all 40 can't be registered at GoDaddy. Um,

1:27:55: so you just have to build it in such a way to minimize the visible footprint from Google. If you mess it up and the

1:28:02: Google figures out that they're all your PBN, in my experience, it won't hurt your website ranking. It will just

1:28:09: de-index your PBN, which I mean sucks because then you lose everything that you've invested in. So that's one of the

1:28:14: core reasons. If you buy my PBN, which we sell on the ice cream truck, I don't

1:28:20: give you the domains, right? What you get when you buy the PBN link is you get a screenshot of the anchor text. I don't

1:28:26: even give you a screenshot of the article because then you could do quote searches and find it on Google. So, you

1:28:32: don't even get that. You get a screenshot of the anchor text. And I've had people ask me, "Well, how do I know you're not just like putting a link in

1:28:39: Word and then screenshotting that and then and sending it to me?" And my answer is, you don't. I might be doing

1:28:44: that. And if you think I'm doing that, then don't buy PBN links from me. But you can't have the domain because then

1:28:50: you can screw the whole thing up by revealing the domain in the wrong place. Um, so yeah, that's the it can be done,

1:28:58: but be careful or you're going to get everything de-indexed and once it's de-indexed, it's burned forever. Like

1:29:03: don't try to recover them. They're just done. Just burn it and move on. Typically, how much content do you have

1:29:08: on one site of your PBN? Uh, 500 to a,000 words per post. But I

1:29:13: mean, the content is cheap these days, right? So, I mean, you can we it used to be shorter, but you can go longer with

1:29:18: AI content. I mean, you can knock yourself out. Yeah. I mean, how many posts you have?

1:29:24: Oh, how many post? Uh, not more than a handful. Um, usually each PBN is limited

1:29:30: to I can't I'd have to go back. I think we limit it to like eight or nine uh

1:29:36: outbound links to sites we're trying to rank. Um, and even that we want to make

1:29:43: sure that there's no pattern on the outbound links, right? So, if all of them had the same eight, that's a

1:29:49: problem. That's a pretty severe pattern and you're going to get de-indexed. So, we do track which domains which uh

1:29:56: websites are linking to to make sure there isn't any pattern. I have a couple of minutes, but Derek, what's up?

1:30:05: Yeah, so this will be quick. I have a page on one of my sites um been in

1:30:11: search console since May and since May it has given me the same error saying

1:30:16: it's not indexed because of a redirect error. There's no redirect. I can't find it anywhere. Not in HD access

1:30:23: redirections whatever. Two, if I do a site search, the page shows up on Google

1:30:28: that it's indexed. Three, if I do a keyword search, the page shows up organically,

1:30:35: right? So sometimes the index report is wrong. I guess what I would say if

1:30:42: you're seeing it with a keyword search and it's showing up organically. If you're see and that's the key one not

1:30:47: not the site colon but the organic you're typing and it's showing up and if you're doing that on incognito browser

1:30:53: or something uh or even better on a device you've never used to search to visit that website and it's showing up

1:31:00: then I wouldn't worry about it. Um, if it is giving you a lot of stress, then I would probably kick that over to my

1:31:07: developer and say, "Hey, what's going on?" And he would probably say the same thing. I mean, if there's actually no

1:31:12: redirect and it's showing up, then I wouldn't worry about it. Usually those errors get fixed faster than several

1:31:18: months. Usually it gets fixed in a week or two, so I'm surprised it's still doing that. But, you know, sometimes

1:31:24: Google is Google, right? Right. Okay. Yep. I keep saying read request indexing and for three months

1:31:30: now it's been like no we're good. So all right that was all. Thank you. Awesome. So real quick Michelle asked,

1:31:36: "Do I have any tools for bulk creation of loc location pages that actually work?" No, we do that all manually. Any

1:31:43: tool that autogenerates internal linking is trash and will hurt your website. Don't use them. Uh unless you find a

1:31:49: really good one, in which case let me know because I would love a tool that did that well. But so far all the ones I've seen are trash. Uh all the PBN

1:31:56: links are follow. Uh there wouldn't be a huge point to doing a no-follow PBN link

1:32:01: and they are blocked for showing the backlinks in all of the tools. So if you

1:32:08: order PBNs from me, I am blocking AFS, Majestic, uh Semrush, uh Moz. So you

1:32:15: won't see him show up in any of those tools. So yet again, I could just be sending you screenshots of Word

1:32:20: documents and you would never know. So yeah, there is some trust there if you want to order. But like I said, if you

1:32:26: don't want to order, then you don't have to. There's any number of other sources that you can use and feel free to. All

1:32:32: right, awesome. Finished up. Got all the questions. I think the one question uh

1:32:38: and then raise your hand if you have a follow-up. I think that worked well. Let me know. Uh if you guys disagree, go

1:32:44: ahead and respond to the post with the recording. Otherwise, uh I will see you

1:32:49: guys Tuesday. It's only like five days from now because it's Thursday. So,

1:32:54: we'll see you guys Tuesday. Thanks for coming. I appreciate it. And uh yeah, we'll talk to you guys later. And thanks, Michelle. A lot of

1:33:01: great questions. All right. Take care. Bye.
