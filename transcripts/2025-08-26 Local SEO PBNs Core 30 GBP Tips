Title for Skool: 2025-08-26 Local SEO PBNs Core 30 GBP Tips

ðŸ“Œ Executive Summary

This weekly call focused heavily on local SEO strategies, with deep dives into PBN link building, the Core 30 content framework, and Google Business Profile optimization. Caleb also announced his upcoming 10K Challenge - building an SEO agency to $10K monthly revenue in 3 months using a low-ticket GBP management offer.

ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways





PBN links are standard practice - Caleb's agency sources one link to every published page, viewing external links as essential validation signals



Core 30 implementation is gradual - Start with one article in month one, then ramp up to 7+ articles monthly based on competition level



GBP structure matters more than keyword research - Focus on matching website structure to GBP categories and services rather than traditional keyword research



Pricing scales with competition - Standard $2K/month works for most clients, but highly competitive markets require $15K-20K monthly budgets



Address visibility is crucial - Service area businesses (hidden addresses) are 50%+ harder to rank than those with visible addresses

ðŸ“Š Main Discussion Points

PBN Links and Content Strategy





External links remain a massive validation signal to Google's algorithm



Standard process: publish content â†’ source one PBN link â†’ set up internal linking



Cost considerations: Quality PBN links add $1K-1.5K monthly for high-volume content production



Blog comments and social signals used to make link patterns appear more natural during publishing velocity increases

Core 30 Framework Implementation





Month 1: GBP audit, landing page optimization, one article with PBN link



Month 2+: Scale to 7+ articles monthly depending on competition



Structure: 3-4 categories with 5-10 services each = ~30 total pages



Highly competitive markets may require 500+ pages over 6-7 months

Local SEO vs Traditional SEO





No keyword research needed for local - focus on primary category + city name



Main goal: rank the GBP higher, not individual website pages



Tools like Ahrefs unnecessary for local clients - GBP interactions and calls matter more than organic traffic



Geographic relevance content used to maintain and improve local rankings over time

GBP Management Best Practices





Match business name exactly to documentation (except omit LLC)



Visible addresses strongly preferred over service area businesses



Category changes often trigger re-verification requirements



Multiple GBPs viable if legitimate separate locations exist

ðŸ’¡ Notable Q&A

Q: Do I need PBN links if content is already ranking on page one for long-tail keywords? A: While positive results suggest it might work without links, Caleb's agency never publishes content without sourcing links due to the massive validation signal they provide.

Q: How do you handle clients wanting to rank for both plumbing and HVAC? A: Use primary/secondary category structure on one GBP rather than creating separate profiles. Build out full content silos for each service area under the same domain.

Q: What's the difference between articles and web pages for SEO? A: No difference for SEO purposes - focus on content and internal linking structure rather than WordPress post vs page designation.

Q: How do you price highly competitive markets? A: Research competitor content volume and timeline needs. Example: 500 pages needed by spring = ~$20K monthly investment based on content velocity requirements.

ðŸ”® Emerging Trends & Challenges





AI content detection increasing - Google's August 2025 spam update targets AI-generated content walls



Visual page development essential - Pages need images, design elements, and proper formatting to avoid being flagged as AI slop



Service area business challenges - Hidden addresses becoming increasingly difficult to rank



GBP verification complexity - Any profile changes can trigger re-verification, requiring proper documentation preparation

ðŸ›  Tools & Resources Mentioned





Lead Snap - $59/month for up to 10 GBPs, $20/month per business for citations (one-time effective cost)



Page Optimizer Pro - Always used for GBP landing pages, extended to category/service pages for competitive markets



Claude Sonnet - Primary tool for content creation



Claude Opus 4 - Used for data analysis tasks



GMB Everywhere - For competitor research and category/service discovery



High Level - Marketing platform with 40% affiliate structure, though usage fees marked up significantly

0:00: Welcome, welcome everyone. Thank you for being here. It is of course 1:00 Central

0:07: Standard Time in the city of New Orleans where it actually isn't super hot today.

0:13: It was pretty nice. And it is August 26th. So today is our last weekly Zoom

0:20: huddle in August. Uh next week's will not be on September 2nd. That is the

0:26: date that you would expect. I'm going to have to move it to September 3rd. I have

0:32: a family wedding in Minneapolis to go to and we're flying home on Tuesday. So,

0:38: let me shift that date right now while I'm thinking about it because obviously otherwise I would forget about it. So,

0:44: we'll just shift that to September 3rd. There we go. Uh, so it's correct on the calendar now, I think. Let me refresh.

0:53: Wait, why does it still say Oh, no. That's the 9th. Perfect. It's golden. It is on September 3rd. That will be our

0:59: next one. In other sort of related news, I've been talking about this for quite a

1:05: while. And Thursday is the day. If you're interested, uh you'll get an

1:11: email. Hopefully, you saw the emails. If you didn't, that's fine, I guess. Um but you should still see more. What is

1:18: happening on Thursday? It's day one of my building an SEO challenge to 10K a

1:25: month in three months with Oh, hey, are you interested? With no sales calls. Uh

1:31: so going to do that Thursday. Uh feel free. It'll be a Zoom. Uh basically, I'm

1:36: going to share my screen and then walk through exactly how I'm building this uh SEO agency. Uh the recordings, you guys

1:44: will be able to access them. All the recordings are going to be in the pro group that you guys have access to. Um,

1:52: okay. And the last thing I'm going to mention, just uh to set the stage with sort of the rules here, um, if you want

1:59: to ask a question verbally, then please raise your hand as Dylan, David, Becky,

2:05: and Robert have already figured out. Good on them. Uh, we're going to have to

2:10: limit it to one question per hand raise. So, if you have a follow-up question, no

2:15: problem. Put your hand down and then put it up again. Uh, just because we can't I

2:21: want to make sure to get to as many different people as possible. I also, uh, as I do every week, uh, I will be

2:28: trying to answer all of the written questions in between each hand raised question. So, if you want your question

2:35: answered quickest, uh, and you aren't Dylan, who was Johnny on the spot with raising his hand straight away, uh, then

2:42: put your question in the chat and I will answer that after every hand raised

2:47: person. Okay? Hopefully that makes sense. That's what we've been doing for the last few weeks. It's allowed me to

2:52: get uh to more people more quickly. So, we'll keep that going. And for now,

2:58: let's kick it off. Dylan, what you got for me today? Hey, Caleb.

3:05: So, my question is for a non-local campaign, dissertation, academic

3:10: consulting stuff. Um, last month I published 50 pieces of supporting content.

3:16: Nice. And pretty much seen all of it indexed through search console. I'm also seeing

3:21: longtail keyword variations um showing up on page one of Google.

3:26: So, my question is, do I need to still do the PBN links? And how do I make sure that the traffic goes to the money pages

3:33: and not the supporting content pages that are currently ranking? Yeah, so traffic going to supporting

3:39: content pages is super common. Um, usually the way that we would adjust

3:44: that is by putting a short, you know, 50, 75 word, maybe even shorter uh blurb

3:52: about the supporting content in the primary content. Uh that way it's

3:58: assigned to Google that this is the primary content about all of these different topics. You'll still see the

4:04: supporting content rank for some longtail keywords. There's not that much you can do about it. Like if somebody

4:10: types in a search and Google thinks that supporting content is going to answer their question first, that's the result

4:16: that it's going to serve. But by putting in the like things like the FAQ schema,

4:22: uh those little blurbs about the supporting content, that can help to demonstrate to Google that that's the

4:28: main article, the main topic. Um now, if you're seeing content rank, if uh you're

4:35: seeing content index on page one for longtail keywords, if the money words that you're targeting are moving up in

4:41: rankings, then I'd probably say no, you might not need to source the PBN links.

4:47: Uh that being said, I say that with a giant asterisk that I cannot remember the last time I published content and

4:53: didn't source a link to it. Uh that's just the normal process that we use. External links is a massive validation

5:00: signal to Google's algorithm. Uh so if you don't do it, I don't know, man. I

5:06: mean, I I don't usually like to guess about things that we haven't done. That's not something that we have done

5:11: in a long time. Uh, but I mean, you're seeing all the positive results from the

5:16: content, so maybe it's worth the risk. Uh, I mean, you said that you're doing

5:21: 50 a month. Uh, so I can see why you'd want to potentially not do the PBN

5:26: links, like, you know, even inexpensive ones that are at least of high enough quality that you'd want to throw it at

5:32: your website. That's, you know, that's going to add up $1,000, $1,500 a month to source links to all that. So, I can

5:38: see your motivation for not doing it. Um, but yeah, I mean, we would be if it were our client. So, um, yeah, hopefully

5:47: that's helpful, Dylan. All right, perfect. Thanks. Awesome. All right, Bruce asks, "Can you

5:53: speak to how you outsource your work and describe what you do personally and what you outsource?" Okay, so that's a good

5:59: question. I'm not going to go it in great detail. Uh, but basically, uh, the

6:04: way that I work things at my agency is anytime we have something that needs to

6:10: get done as part of a regular process, I will almost always do it myself first.

6:17: Um, just to get a feel for how does this work, how long does it take, how hard is

6:22: this, how challenging is this, and then the second time I do it, I'll do it myself again for the second time. But

6:29: the second time I'll record myself doing it right every little step of the way. You've seen that in the onboarding

6:34: videos where I go through doing this, doing this, doing this. And then the third time I will give it to one of my

6:40: employees along with all the recordings and say, "Okay, do this." And then I'll, you know, double check every single

6:46: step, make sure everything was done uh correctly. And over time, that double-checking gets less and less and

6:52: less. Um, so right now I have a manager for my SEO agency and she pretty much

7:00: takes care of 90% of the ongoing work for my agency which

7:08: is great uh because I don't need to worry about it, think about it uh when big things come up like you know uh a

7:15: couple months ago we landed a plastic surgeon client in New York City. Plastic surgeon New York City is obviously very

7:21: very competitive. So, that was a client that we had some discussions about. What do we want to do? How do we want to

7:26: manage this? So, for one-off cases like that or another example, we've had clients before who are just like their

7:34: ranking is terrible. Um, but they have 900 indexed URLs and all the three

7:40: competitors have like 30 a piece, right? So, they're they're ranked 20 plus, but they have 900 indexed URLs. So, there's

7:46: clearly something fundamentally wrong with the website. So then I'll get involved in a client like that and we'll

7:52: talk about it. We'll do the screaming frog and try to figure out what's going on as part of that technical audit. But

7:58: you know uh carpet cleaner garage door repair stuff like that like client come

8:05: client uh reaches out agrees to the price agrees to going forward with SEO

8:10: engagement. Um the client will get emailed all the onboarding documentation that we have which isn't very much. Um,

8:17: and a very short Loom video. I think it's 2 and 1/2 minutes long that basically shows here's how to grant

8:23: access to the GBP, here's how to grant access to Google Analytics, and here's how to grant access to WordPress. Uh, if

8:30: they have their website on a platform that isn't WordPress and they are having trouble getting access to it, we'll

8:35: figure it out. Um, but you know, most people are WordPress. So anyway, uh

8:41: that's basically Do you do you do full employees or do you contract out uh

8:46: do you have contract employees? When you say employees, most of them most of the people who work for me are full employees. I do have a

8:53: couple of 1099 contractors. Uh generally they're used for very like oneoff do X Y

9:00: and Z type uh roles. Um most of the people who work for me are employees.

9:07: Great. Thank you, Davidid. How are you? Oh, wait. I'm sorry. Yeah, let's go, David. I I

9:12: already called in. Let's go. I forgot I forgot my own rule, but that's fine. We'll we'll get back to them. How are

9:17: you, man? What you got for me? I'm good. Thank you. Uh thank you. Um

9:23: well, I got uh first one question again about geographic relevance. So, I have

9:28: the massage which is ranking well. I did the geographic relevance. Now, I need to

9:34: do geographic relevance for acupuncture. Can I just add the a paragraph on the

9:40: geographic relevance that is already here about acupuncture or should I do a new geographic relevance page and

9:47: neighborhood about acupuncture? So this is a new usually we would do a

9:52: new one if it's a new topic. So it's yeah it's a new topic. So a new one but same as the other but with the

9:59: the new keyword. Yeah. Yeah. It's so it's similar to the other.

10:05: It's just another geographic relevance topic, but it's targeting different keywords with this new geographic target, the new service. Absolutely.

10:12: Okay. Am I making sense? Yeah. Yeah. Just to to to be sure uh to

10:17: be sure that perfect. All right. So, let's see. Manny asks, uh, I have a question on the core

10:24: 30 and website design. I've watched the call recording. It sounds like if you change up your website, Google doesn't like it. That's true. But if you do the

10:30: core 30 and add categories and services, you need to add those to the website. So, when I say Google doesn't like changing up the website, that that's

10:36: really like Google doesn't like a redesign. When you're adding content to the website, that's we haven't had any

10:42: issues with that, right? So, we're going to add content. Uh we'll add content to the GBP landing page. Uh we'll add new

10:48: pages of content. Google doesn't like that helps, right? That's what we want to do to provide that topical relevance.

10:54: When I say Google doesn't like it when you change up your website, that means like if you took your GVP landing page, deleted everything, redesigned it, uh

11:02: new images, new content, that would likely have a negative impact on ranking. So, we don't want to like

11:07: redesign uh make huge changes, but when we add content, of course, we do something like that. Um, all right. And

11:15: George asks, can we go over keywords? I just signed up your course. Welcome, George. Good timing. And I have six

11:21: clients, customers I need help with. That's great. Congrats. Six is awesome. So for local SEO, we don't do keyword

11:26: research. Um hopefully that is helpful. We uh uh for local SEO, we're trying to

11:32: rank for GBP primary category, city name. And beyond that, if there's a

11:38: couple of really important services that they care about, my best famous example

11:43: that I always talk about is plumbers. So, when we have plumbers, we're trying to rank for plumber city name, water

11:49: heater replacement city name, and main drain line replacement city name. That's it. Those are our three target keywords.

11:56: Uh, we don't care about anything else. We don't target anything else. We don't track anything else. Um, because most of

12:03: the plumbers I talk to don't actually want to rank for leaky faucet or clogged toilet or things like that. So, it's the

12:08: keywords that they actually want to get customers for and the primary category for local SEO. The reason we don't need

12:15: to focus on keyword research like we do a non-local is because remember for local SEO everything we're trying to do

12:22: is rank the GBP higher. We are not trying to rank websites. We're not trying to rank service pages. We're not

12:28: trying to rank articles or blogs or anything like that. All we're trying to do is get the GBP to rank higher. And

12:35: when the GBP ranks higher for the most competitive term, which is in 95% of

12:42: cases, primary category, city name, when it ranks high for that, it's going to

12:47: rank high for most of the longtail keywords. So that's why we generally don't do keyword research for local.

12:53: We've basically found it to be a waste of time. Uh in the first iteration of AI

12:59: SEO Mastery Pro, I did have modules on keyword research. in the current updated

13:05: one, which I think we rolled out a few months ago, there's no modules on keyword research for local SEO because

13:11: we don't do it. Um, so yeah, we don't put it in there. Uh, I actually don't have a even a

13:16: subscription to ah refs anymore because we only take local clients and we don't need a tool like ah refs for local

13:23: clients. Uh, it's a waste of money, frankly. Yeah, thank you for saying that because we were stumped. My uh son and I are are

13:30: doing this. Like I have a marketing company and these clients now I've added

13:36: SEO as a service and they all want it and we barely know what we're doing but you know we're we're figuring it out. Um

13:43: so uh we have one in your favorite place uh med spa in um Indiana.

13:53: Awesome. Yeah. Fort Wayne. Got to love Fort Wayne Indiana. And how how would you like for the category of

13:59: I'm gonna go ahead and mute you real real quick there George just because I don't want to get too far off of topic versus going through the written

14:05: questions followup question. No problem. Go ahead put your hand back up. Put a follow-up question in the chat but I

14:10: just don't want to get too derailed because we do have quite a few people here and I have a hard back end at about

14:16: 2:30. So sorry about that. Okay. Uh Matthew says going through your incredible

14:23: course. Well that's a good way to get attention. Just call it that. Appreciate it. Uh list of list of quick questions.

14:29: Oh, it feels like somebody's been uh stocking up here. What if the client has not set up the search console? Then set

14:34: up the search console forum. No problem. You should be able to do that. It should take 5 minutes. For the people also ask

14:40: questions, you always put them in FAQ section. Does your FAQ section get message? We almost always do put them in

14:46: the FAQ section. And the main reason we do that is so that we can put in FAQ schema which both Google loves and chat

14:53: GPT loves. So, we love putting FAQ schema and in order to put that in, we need an FAQ. So, we almost always put

15:00: that in there. Um, we won't put like a hundred FAQ, right? Like that's kind of

15:07: insane. So, if we need more than, you know, 10 to 15, we'll start to shift the

15:13: other uh FAQs to other internal pages, not just keep adding and adding and

15:18: adding to the GBP homepage, GBP landing page. Um, if I wanted to turn it all out

15:24: in a day or two, is it okay to publish all at once? Generally, it sure is. How often do you use Page Optimizer Pro?

15:30: Well, almost always use it for the GBP landing page. And then whether we use it for pages below the GBP landing page,

15:36: uh, is a question of competitiveness, right? So, always the GBP landing page. If it's a plumber in Fort Wayne, that's

15:43: it. We're going to use it on the landing page and that's all. uh for a plastic surgeon in New York City, we used it on

15:49: the category pages and then we used it again on the service pages. So the more competitive the space is, the more we

15:55: use it. Um when do you use blog comments? Blog comments are a way to

16:01: signal to Google that the business owner is active online. So if we have a big push of content or we're doing a step

16:07: change in publishing velocity, uh we're going to get a bunch of PBN links in uh as part of that increase in publishing

16:14: velocity. Then we'll combine that with blog comments, social signals, and often a press release just to make sure that,

16:22: you know, in a two-eek period, we don't have 30 PBN links coming to the site and nothing else, right? So, if we're just

16:29: doing a regular publishing velocity, 5, 10, 15 a month, and it's consistent for several months, then we'll probably do

16:35: blog comments every 3 or 4 months. But if we're publishing at that volume and we're not seeing the results, uh we need

16:41: to do a step change in uh publishing volume, then we're going to add these other links just to make it look more

16:47: natural. Um so Claude versus ChatgPT5. So Claude is what we use almost all the

16:54: time still. Uh Claude Sonnet is what we use for writing content. Claude Opus 41

17:00: is what we use for nearly all of the data analysis. I have a subscription to Chant GPT um but not a pro. It's only

17:06: the 20 month subscription. My biggest use case for chat GPT is honestly the

17:12: voice chats. Uh I really enjoy the chat GPT voice chats. They really help me brainstorm. Uh I'm I'm the type of

17:19: person when I'm brainstorming, I often brainstorm out loud. Uh so my employees are very happy that chat GPT had the

17:26: voice chat so that I'd stop calling them to brainstorm at them. Uh, and what's great about that is when the

17:31: brainstorming session is over, uh, ChatGpt will happily summarize everything, come up with action items or

17:37: or anything else that I need from it. So, like that's pretty much all I use chat GPT5 for. Um, a couple of things. I

17:46: use chat GP chat GPT a lot more for personal questions than for Claude. And that's mainly uh Claude did roll out an

17:53: update I think earlier this week where Claude would uh remember your chats from

17:59: other chats. Um the fact that Claude doesn't remember from one chat to the next is a big advantage if you're using

18:06: cloud projects and you give it all the information you want it to use for this specific prompts. But if I just have a

18:12: personal question like hey how did this run go? And then I want to give it my heart rate data and pace. uh then I'm

18:19: going to use chatgpt because it's going to remember from chat to chat. Um so yeah, that's basically the the use case

18:26: split. If if I just have some quick little question, I'm going to go to chat GPT and if it's for like to do work for

18:32: a client, it's almost always claude. Um I didn't think chat g when in my

18:38: personal experience with chat GPT, I didn't see a big difference uh of five versus the 40 that I was using. But

18:45: anyway, uh I sync Bing with the GBP. Yep. That's usually what we do. My initial heat mapap map is pretty good

18:52: while I need citations. Uh so the lead snap citations I would do them regardless. It's 20 bucks and you know

18:58: hopefully you have 20 bucks to work on a client. If not really think about your pricing structure. Uh those citations

19:06: they are helpful for Google but the thing I really love about them is they help to get a bunch of branded mentions

19:11: out there uh for chat GPT. Uh do you track with a heat map more than your

19:16: main keyword? So, we're going to track the like the keywords that we really care about. So, the plumber example, we're going to track those three

19:22: keywords. Plumber main city, uh, water heater replacement main city, and main drain line replacement main city. And

19:29: that's it. So, we'll just track those three. Uh if we have a client who does 30 different things and they really

19:35: really care about all 30 like that's most common like a general contractor uh because they really care about like

19:40: general contractor, construction company, uh kitchen remodel, bathroom remodel. Then we might end up tracking

19:47: nine 10 different keywords. Usually it's not more than three or four. Uh when you

19:52: take on a new client, do you try to change their Google profile name and choose a keyword? Absolutely not. uh we

19:58: make sure their Google business profile name matches their business name. Um

20:03: putting a keyword in your Google business profile, it can give you a bump in rankings. It absolutely can. But uh

20:10: when you do that, it uh can be very spammy and it then starts to get other

20:16: businesses very tempted to report your business profile. Uh, and if they do that and it's not your actual business

20:23: name, you can get suspended and it's very hard to get unsuspended because you don't have the paperwork that matches

20:28: the Google business profile name. So then you end up having to change it back to your real business name anyway. Um,

20:35: yeah, tricks like that like we don't really employ him very much. Uh, we just do SEO the way that we have it in the

20:42: training. We're just uh doing the content and the links to build relevance and trust. All right, that was a long one, Matthew.

20:49: No problem, Becky. How are you? No problem. What's going on, Becky? What

20:55: you got for me? I have a question about you. You

21:00: recommend two to three or three to five categories and then pages. Um, I have a

21:06: client where there's only two categories that could work. Is that going to end up

21:12: hurting me by mapping three services to the second category?

21:19: like is that is is is the spread I guess

21:24: from categories to service mappings and the links on the pages is that part of

21:29: what makes this work? Uh so it's really that we want the

21:36: website structure to match the GBP structure. Okay. Right. Um, and ideally, so we really

21:43: want to see like 20 or 30 services and like three or four uh categories. So we

21:50: really would like to see like five to 10 services per category. Um, if you can't

21:56: come up with that many and you've used GMBB everywhere, you've done the AI prompts and there's just nothing that's

22:01: that's applicable and you've looked at your competitors in the area, then I mean go with what you have, right? Don't

22:07: don't stretch so hard that you're putting non semantically relevant things on your GBP. Uh that's only going to

22:13: hurt you. Um but yeah, like usually we can find stuff, but I mean sometimes we

22:18: can't, right? And there are some clients that we have one category because that was the only thing that makes sense. We

22:24: have um it's like a telecommunications company where they do like low voltage

22:29: wiring and they do like telephone systems and stuff like that. And there's just they just have one category and

22:34: it's not even the keyword they want to rank for. or some other random thing that is the best thing they could do. Um,

22:40: and you were you were still able to get them ranking? Yes. Yeah. Okay.

22:45: All right. Cool. Uh, all right. Cool. So, let's go to um

22:54: Mike Stevens. Mike says, "Can you off for more details about internal links for SEO bots only seeing the first

23:01: mention of a link on each page in the so more so internal links for SEO?

23:06: Basically, we're using internal links to structure the website. Uh Googlebot,

23:12: which is the only one that we really care about for internal links, uh Google bot will follow all of your links. Uh it

23:19: will see every single link on the page. If you have multiple links to the same

23:25: URL, Googlebot will see all of those links to the same URL. But the way internal SEO link juice passing works is

23:34: it will only pass the internal authority to the first link it sees. Right? So if

23:40: you have a link to your service page in your navbar, that's going to be above every other link on your page. And

23:45: navbar links don't pass any authority. Um so then you're not going to get authority over to your service page.

23:52: That is not a big deal at all for local SEO because remember for local SEO you're not trying to rank the service

23:57: page, you're trying to rank the GBP. This is a really big deal for non-local SEO, right? For non-local SEO, you

24:05: should really be avoiding putting the pages you're trying to rank in your navbar. For local SEO is not a problem

24:13: at all. Uh don't worry about it too much. Uh next question, what pages should we give priority to? For PBNs, we

24:20: generally point uh one link to every new page we publish.

24:26: Um as I mean so there's no real priority. We just do one link to every page. All right. Uh Becky wants me to

24:34: ask a question in the community. I I don't want to open the school community just right now in the middle of this call, but we'll work on it. It's been a

24:41: very busy day. I woke up with like 70 notifications from school this morning.

24:46: O we're working there. We'll get there. We'll get there. All right, Braden, do you build out services for the main

24:52: category? If so, where do you link them? Oh, uh, so for the main category, for the main category, we'll usually do two

24:59: or three services because we don't want 15 outbound links from the homepage. Uh,

25:05: so we'll do two or three uh link them from the homepage uh because the homepage is the main category page.

25:12: Hopefully, that's helpful. So for our plumber who really wants water heater replacement and main drain line replacement, we're going to put those

25:19: two categories on the homepage on the GBP landing page. All right, the homepage has the main category but

25:26: doesn't list all the services of that category sends to another page that lists all the services. What should be

25:31: the H1 of this category page that lists all the services? Um I am not sure I'm following what's

25:39: going on. Uh, so the homepage is the primary category and it should list all

25:45: of the services under the primary category that's on your GBP. Um, if that's not the case because maybe you

25:52: only have one category and you have 30 services and you don't want to list 30 pages on the homepage, uh, then what

25:58: you're doing is you're putting an intermediate service page to list all of the services. And that way you can have

26:03: just the two or three categories you really care about on the homepage. That seems like what you're doing. So, what

26:09: should the H1 be? Doesn't matter. You're not trying to rank that page. Uh, usually it could just be like services,

26:16: brand, city, like including words like that in there. Yeah. Uh, chat GPT is

26:22: better at schema. I've actually found Claude to be better at schema when I had uh I was on a live stream last week and

26:28: tried to have chat GPT write schema for me and it kept giving me schema riddled with errors. Uh, it had one error, but

26:35: one error is riddled with errors. And I gave that to I tried three times to get

26:40: chat GPT to uh fix it and it never could. I gave it over to Claude and the first output. Perfect. No errors.

26:47: Exactly what I wanted. So anyway, uh Claude I think is much better at coding than chat GPT including with schema. But

26:53: if you have great experience with it then go for it. All right. What do you think about breadcrumbs? Our location pages and local core pages are set as

27:00: custom. We try to uh breadcrumb schema is great. We don't we don't custom write

27:05: breadcrumb schema uh because again the biggest thing that breadcrumb schema does uh is it gives your it gives Google

27:13: an idea of the flow of the website and it can sometimes have internal site links show up on the search engine

27:19: results page right but remember we're not trying to rank URLs we're trying to rank the GBP so we don't care what the

27:27: schema does on the search engine results page we care what it does to the GBP. Um

27:32: so uh we'll often use a plugin RankMath uh is is a is a good one and it

27:38: autogenerates breadcrumb schema and then that's it. I unfortunately am not technically detailed enough to be able

27:44: to answer technically detailed questions about breadcrumb schema. It gets complicated fast is the extent of my

27:50: knowledge about it and my team uh takes care of it for me. So that I guess those

27:56: are the two things I know about it. I have people who take care of it and it gets over my head. I am not I I I I I

28:01: have never done development work. Um so I have no idea how to do any of it. All right. So let's do one more and then

28:07: we'll get over to Robert. I go to chat voice and copy over to cloud. Perfect. Yep. That's a good way to do it too.

28:13: Jay, thank you. All right, Robert. What you got for me, man? Uh I I have a client that's uh confused

28:21: with his services. So he's been with for about four months. started out as a

28:26: concrete contractor and he does like hardscaping and so like landscaping is in there too. He wants to switch over to

28:33: pools. So in the GBP there's a swimming pool contractor as well. Uh so his main

28:40: category was and is currently concrete contractor. What is that like trying to

28:46: switch that over? because his GBP has already been not suspended but needing to get reverified for like two months

28:52: cuz he switched categories like after we were a month in. Uh and then his GBP was

28:58: down for for months. He moved to an actual location where he can show its

29:03: business now like not his home address and got it reverified just a couple

29:09: weeks ago but now wants to focus on pools. So more than likely is that going to trigger a reverification again? So,

29:16: in my experience, you any change you make on a GBP can trigger reverification. You could go in there

29:22: and tick the box that says you're LGBTQ friendly and that could trigger reverification, right? Anything can do

29:28: it. Uh, most of the time that won't do it. So, in my experience, the most common things to trigger reverification

29:35: are number one, an address change, number two a business name change, and number three a primary category change.

29:42: So, it is, I would say, probably worse than even odds, like less than 5050, uh,

29:48: that it would trigger a reverification. But even so, for any of those three big changes, we're always going to make sure

29:55: that the client is prepared to re-record a video verification in case it gets re

30:02: like has the reverification triggering. It's usually not a big deal to re-record

30:07: the verification. uh as long as they're ready for it, they have their paperwork ready, they have the signage done, they

30:13: have their business cards, all that stuff that's in the verification module that we have in the classroom. If they

30:19: have all that stuff ready, then, you know, go for it. Make the change. Just be ready to re-record. Uh if you want to

30:26: be a little bit safer, you might wait uh until it's been about a month or so since you got the reverification done.

30:34: Then the probability would go down a little bit. Uh, but at the end of the day, like changing the primary category

30:40: will often trigger reverification. What about adding because he doesn't even have swimming pool contractor as a

30:47: category. Adding categories, I've seen it happen. Um, but if you're adding one category,

30:53: it's unusual. Uh, I'll say it that way. Usually with adding categories, like if you have one category and then you went

30:59: in and you added nine more, um, I would say that would likely trigger a reverification. But just adding one, I

31:07: mean it still can, right? Because Google is Google and that happened last week. I added a category. He was a tree

31:13: service and he had tree trimming as a category and he wanted to add drains and I did it and he now he needs to get

31:20: reverified it. So yeah, it it happens. Uh but yeah, so that's just be ready for

31:28: reverification, I guess, is is the best advice to give. And um yeah, like I

31:34: don't know cuz he'll also whatever rank position he has now for contractor or for concrete contractor, he's almost

31:41: certainly going to lose that. Uh it won't translate over to a swimming pool uh rank map. So I mean, you know, just

31:50: have him stop changing his primary category, man. Like Yeah. Do you have other Have you had

31:55: better luck with having the owner of the GBP change make changes over you as a

32:01: manager? usually the best luck that we've had in not triggering a reverification. Uh that

32:07: that's a good question and you're not supposed to do follow-up questions, but that's a good one. So, it's okay, right?

32:13: Um so usually what we'll do is um if we just like absolutely do do not want to

32:19: have a reverification issue and this works with anything with business name change, address change, phone number,

32:24: categories is we'll have somebody who's like a highlevel local guide which basically means somebody who has a

32:30: Google account and they left a lot of reviews. You gain levels as the more reviews you leave. So if that person who

32:36: is not associated with the GBP, right, they they're not a manager, they are not an owner, uh they're not an editor,

32:42: whatever the other categories are, if they go in and they recommend the primary category change and then the

32:49: manager or owner goes in and approves that change, that will almost never

32:54: trigger a reverification. Almost never. I haven't ever seen it happen, but I can't say never because it again, Google

33:01: does weird things. Um, so that's usually the safest way to make changes if you're really like uh worried about a

33:08: reverification. That's also a pain in the ass. So, usually we just have clients get ready to redo the

33:13: verification. Um, all right. Braden asks, "Is lead snap citations just yexed?" Man, coming

33:21: in hot, Braden. I don't think so. Uh, lead snap is $20 a month. Uh, Yex is

33:27: also in the 20 to $30 a month range. Um, so that would be really weird. the owner

33:32: of Lead Snap isn't here. We can have him on one one Tuesday if you guys want to ask more detailed questions. Uh but the

33:38: So, you know, first of all, if it was just Yex, there's no profit margin in there for the tool. So, I don't think it

33:44: is. U and then the other reason I don't think it is. The bigger reason I don't think it is is because if you cancel

33:50: your citations with Yex, all of the citations are deleted. If you cancel your citations with Lead Snap, they

33:56: still stay around. So, we say Lead Snap is $20 a month for citations. It's really like a $20 onetime charge because

34:03: you don't need to pay for the second month. They don't delete the citations if you cancel that service, but Yex

34:08: will. So, that's why I don't think it's Yex, but I don't know for sure. And I don't care. I don't care what device

34:16: Patrick is using to get citations. Yeah, whatever. All right. Lolita, when I click in the reference links in the boot

34:23: camp, it says me do a video I don't have access to. Okay. Somebody else asked me this question today also. Um, man,

34:29: nobody's been using the boot camp for a hot minute and uh, somebody asked me this question last night and I went in

34:35: and I looked at the boot camp and a lot of the stuff in there was talking about keyword research for local businesses

34:41: and stuff like that and the links from there were going to videos that weren't in AI Mastery Pro anymore because we, as

34:49: I said at the top of the call, we don't really do keyword research for local. So, I actually removed all of the that

34:54: stuff from the SEO boot camp. Uh, so it's not another course. Uh, I don't have anything that you guys and pro

35:01: don't have access to. I keep hearing from people that I should come out with a much more expensive, higher ticket

35:08: offer. Uh, but I don't got any ideas on what that could possibly be. Uh, because everything I know is in the AI SEO

35:14: Mastery Pro tier. Um, so yeah, it's not another course. Like you're you're that that you're you're at the top. That's

35:21: it. uh stuff like what you're talking about. You can send me a message on school and I can look into it like what

35:27: happened when it was just outdated stuff because the boot camp. Yeah. Um it's an

35:32: older offering that I let get old and uh didn't keep updating it. So, sorry about

35:37: that. Uh okay, Hberto, do you offer a service to review a business we're working on that's having difficulty

35:43: ranking? We'd love your advice on what we might be missing.

35:49: So potentially um those of those of you you guys know that the ice cream truck

35:55: shop is obviously my shop for fulfillment. Um and my uh employee is

36:01: actually in the process of revamping everything that's in the ice cream truck shop. I would say one of the most common

36:08: requests I get from people who are watching my YouTube videos is if we can do like an audit to help that give them

36:15: a path forward on uh local SEO. So we are adding that option to the ice cream

36:21: truck shop. still trying to figure out exactly what that's going to work look like because I don't want it to be like

36:27: five grand, but I also want it to be something that is, you know, focused and dedicated enough that will actually give

36:34: you actionable, uh, information. Uh, in the interim, um, you know, we've done

36:41: this once before. We can talk about doing it again. we can have one of these Tuesdays where instead of just an open Q&A like this, maybe uh we take a look

36:48: at one website together and then we're just going to dive into that one website and be like, "Okay, what's going on?

36:54: What do we want to do? What's the path forward?" Um I did that once a few months ago. Boy, it was probably more

37:01: than a few months ago. Uh but I have done it before just diving into a website. So uh let me know guys if you

37:07: think that would be valuable uh more valuable than these open Q&As. I'm I'm game to do that, too. Happy to do a live

37:15: breakdown of a website. All right. Uh Joshua, new to the community. Welcome, Joshua. Great to have you. I'm curious

37:22: about social signals. I'm okay with outsourcing, but I also want enough knowledge to do it on my own. So, when I'm told there are thousand signals and

37:28: seminar from Pinterest, what does that actually mean? So, basically what that means is uh a bunch of people will post

37:33: your URL on a bunch of social platforms. Um that's it. That's what that means. so

37:39: that your URL shows up a whole bunch in a bunch of different social platforms on on a whole bunch of different accounts.

37:45: Uh we spent quite a while building up all these different accounts. So, uh we just basically post on all of them when

37:52: uh the social signals are are placed. It's really just the VA time uh to do

37:57: that, which is why uh that particular service is not super expensive. We don't

38:02: use it very often. You're not going to rank because you did a bunch of social signals. It's really just to deflect

38:08: away from um a bunch of uh like PBNs like I was talking about

38:14: earlier. Uh hopefully that's helpful. All right, Lamoda, I have my first client. Congrats. And they don't have

38:21: the budget to do the core 30. Hopefully they're in a low competitive area. My plan is to optimize the homepage with

38:27: service blurbs. Yep. And that way homepage is the landing page and Yeah.

38:32: So, uh, so basically a client with no budget, generally we

38:38: wouldn't take that client on. That being said, uh, if you're relatively new, just getting started, makes perfect sense.

38:44: Got to get your feet wet somewhere. So, this type of structure basically where you're doing everything as if your next

38:51: step was the core 30 is exactly what we would do. And frankly, that's what we usually do for a new client, right?

38:58: Somebody says, "Yep, I want to be a client." The first thing we're going to do is the GBP audit where we're going to

39:03: manually walk through their GBP, make sure the categories are correct, make sure their services are correct, make

39:09: sure like the GBP landing page has NAP matching the embed, all of that jazz.

39:15: The second thing we do is a detailed look at their GBP landing page, which is usually the homepage. Uh, and in that,

39:22: we're going to add a little bit of content. We're going to do make sure the embeds are done. Make sure the local business schema. Uh we're going to add

39:28: the nested service schema. We're going to do all of that jazz on their GBP landing page. Then we're going to do a

39:34: manual technical walk through. Um a lot of sites don't need this, but uh those

39:40: who do, it's worth doing. And for that one, we just basically walk through the site manually. Hey, is anything wrong?

39:45: Do they have a no index tag? any like uh this would be something that we'd really want to pay attention to if uh the

39:52: example I've given you know you have 700 indexed URLs and your local ranking sucks uh then that's usually a sign that

39:59: there's something deeper wrong with the website uh so then we'll do that manual walkthrough

40:06: uh and uh yeah then we basically just start producing content to fill out the core 30 uh so what you're talking about

40:14: is basically the GVP landing page edit which can work really well to give them

40:20: rank movement, right? Uh so if you run a rank a local rank map and then you'll

40:25: you fix their title tag, fix their H1, add these service blurbs uh as H2s, add

40:32: the local business schema, do all that stuff for the GBP landing page, uh then you'll often see the rank map will get

40:38: significantly better in a few weeks. Uh which is great. Um, and when you do

40:44: that, then, uh, often you can potentially have the conversation about, okay, well, what we need to do to

40:49: actually rank is start to build out the core 30, more pages, etc., etc. Um, and

40:56: when the Wow, we'll update the website. Okay. Yeah. So, that's exactly what we said. Uh, so, so it says so update

41:03: website. So, and it sounds like you're talking about moving to a new URL. I would not move them to a new URL. I

41:08: would use their existing website, existing URL, just add content to that. Uh, I hate new URLs. Uh, it's going to

41:15: take you six months to rank a new URL. Even if even if their budget was a h 100red grand and they're trying to rank

41:20: for carpet cleaning in Mobile, Alabama, it's going to take you six months because Google hates new things. Um, all

41:27: right. So, we'll uh I got so many comments. Everyone really took me to heart with the comments. All right.

41:33: We'll skip back over to Alexander here and then we'll come over to your uh comment Brian even though your hand is

41:39: also up but that's fine. Uh what you got Alexander? I'm jealous of where you are man. That's a looks nice.

41:45: I appreciate it. Out here on the little Wakamico River in Northern Virginia for a couple weeks here. Good little spot.

41:51: But uh yeah man, thanks for getting to me. I really I I stopped using Google

41:56: Analytics for local uh a while ago. I was really just got into Google Search

42:02: Console and AFS and uh Google business profile data and I'm wondering if I'm missing the boat on something with with

42:08: G4. I just want to know what you're primarily using it for on your side.

42:14: So, let's see. The last time I used Analytics was because uh one of my

42:19: clients, they actually sold to a private equity firm and this private equity firm

42:25: sent me an email and said, "How many people have looked at the terms of service and privacy policy pages in the

42:31: last 6 months?" Now, there's no way to answer that question, I don't think, unless you have analytics installed.

42:37: Luckily, we did. So, I loaded up analytics uh and then gave them the answer. And the answer was like, "All

42:43: right, welcome. today of course like something insanely low like you know uh 500,000 total

42:50: sessions and 16 of them were to the privacy policy page which makes sense what idiot is going to the privacy

42:55: policy page of a local business right 16 out of 500,000 apparently uh beyond that

43:01: we don't really use uh Google Analytics like obviously uh it can be very helpful for paid ads uh but it doesn't link up

43:09: with the GBP and the GBP is basically all we're trying to do for local. So,

43:14: um, we ask for analytics access just for like oneoff type things. Uh, or the

43:21: other big thing we might use it for is a client might, you know, maybe we're writing like tier three content, like

43:28: we're writing supporting content for a service page, uh, or we're writing like supporting content for geographical

43:34: relevance, something that's like three levels below the homepage. So then maybe

43:39: we'll load up analytics and uh show them a report on how many people view their tier 3 content just so that when we keep

43:46: telling them like you don't need to spend 45 minutes reviewing this content, no one will ever read it. Uh they'll

43:53: maybe hopefully believe us when we show them the analytics data that no one actually ever reads it. Um in a local

43:59: business website like almost no one goes past the landing page. Um but yeah, I

44:04: mean that's really about it. Like I don't know. Let me guys let Alexander and I know in in the chat here if you

44:12: have a better use case for Google Analytics on local, but that's all we do with it. Um, I don't even know how to

44:19: set it up. Like there's a guy in Upwork I use to set it up when we need to create a new analytics account. Like

44:25: it's just not something and you said search console and AHFS. I I'll be honest with you, we barely use those for

44:32: local SEO because again the GBP interactions, clicks and all of that. They don't they don't get reported on

44:38: the search console. Uh so almost the only thing we do with the search console today for local uh is we'll use the

44:45: indexing report if there's an issue with the website. There isn't an issue with most local business websites. So that's

44:52: only, you know, those big websites that, you know, they've been around for 10 years and they've been doing blog posts

44:58: every week for, you know, 10 years and it's a terrible website that doesn't rank. Then we'll use the index report.

45:04: And uh AHFs, I haven't had an AHF subscription in 4 months. Yeah, we just just none of that. We don't need any of

45:11: that for local. Um, I actually had somebody come to me with an e-commerce

45:16: site and ask if we could do uh SEO for their e-commerce site and I I told them

45:22: no, like we I don't have the systems, I don't have the tools, I don't have the employees, I don't have the process to

45:27: do non-local SEO anymore. Uh, we shifted hard into local SEO in uh early 2023 and

45:35: and haven't looked back. Which that reminds me that reminds me everyone who who's here today today August 26th is

45:45: the 1,000th day that chat GPT has been released to the public. Um so anyway,

45:52: that's a fun milestone to think about. Yeah, the Brian thumbs yeah thousandth day of chat GPT and how it and chat GPT5

46:02: is, you know, in my humble opinion, obviously it does better on all these metrics, but in terms of like its actual

46:07: use case and how people actually use it, it doesn't seem that different to me than what chat GPT3 and a half was three

46:15: years ago. Uh, but maybe I'm being uh pessimistic about that. Anyway, all right, cool. Thanks, Alexander. Uh,

46:22: yeah, thanks Caleb. Let's get back to the written ones. Brian asks, "Can you have two GBPs in the same town? One for

46:29: plumber and one for HVAC if they rent an office, different location, same town, and had one employee." Yeah. Yeah. So,

46:35: uh, we could do that. Uh, you could do that. Two GBPs in the same town. Generally, um, if they actually have two

46:44: locations and two businesses and everything is separate, then we will do two GBPs. Uh usually if it's one

46:52: business and they do plumber and HVAC, which is super common, right? It's super common to see plumber and HVAC together,

46:59: then we'll just do uh whichever one they want more jobs, primary category, and then secondary category will be the

47:05: other one. And yes, if plumber is their primary category, it's going to be pretty hard to rank an HVAC to rank also

47:12: for HVAC contractor as their secondary. Uh, and I know you said HVAC contractor, but just real quick, uh, for my

47:18: experience, uh, the more valuable category for an HVAC contractor is air

47:24: conditioning repair. Um, because usually when people have an issue with their air

47:30: conditioner, they're searching for somebody to like it stopped working, so they start searching for air conditioning repair, and then the HVAC

47:37: contractor comes over and says, "It's busted. You need to replace it." Very few people will actually call after an

47:44: HVAC contractor search. Most people don't search for that and most pe most people don't search for air conditioning

47:50: replacement. Uh it's usually the repair that leads to the replacement. Um and we only know that because we work with a

47:56: bunch of HVAC contractors and their primary categories are all air conditioning repair. But anyway, um so

48:02: whichever one of those is the most valuable, we'll do that as the primary and it will be hard to rank the secondary category because that's

48:08: competitive. Um, but I think it's easier to rank a competitive secondary category

48:15: than to rank a whole new GBP with a whole new do domain where you're starting from scratch again, right? Cuz

48:22: you still can build out your core 30 underneath your plumber secondary

48:27: category, then build out your full core 30 underneath that plumber secondary category page. So, it sort of starts to

48:35: look like a multilocation business, but you're just siloing the topical relevance between the air conditioning

48:41: repair and the plumber. Um, hopefully that's hopefully that's helpful. Um,

48:46: Devid, have you observed that when you create geographical content, rankings improve initially but then weaken? Uh,

48:52: yeah. I mean, that's pretty common, right? It depends on what the other competitors are doing in the area. Uh so that's why, you know, even if we have a

48:59: very long-term client that we've been doing SEO for 10 years, uh we're still

49:05: very regularly producing geographical relevance content because, right, someone else bumped up in some area and

49:11: pushed them down to the fourth spot. We're going to produce geographic relevance and turn that four back into a three. And we can also do

49:21: uh the GBP posts uh stuff like that focused on that geographic spot to turn it back.

49:27: All right. Lamoda asks, "I'm building an agency website. Excellent. Plan to go up multiple niches, roofers, restaurants

49:33: from SEO, rid of one main site that are hyperfocused on." So, this is a

49:40: very specific question and um my knee-jerk reaction to this is it feels

49:46: like you're probably overthinking it. Um so, the problem with a local website

49:52: that's hyperfocused on specific verticals is that the search volume is going to be infantessimal. Uh I mean,

49:58: unless you're in a massive city like Houston or something. Uh but right like

50:03: if you're in Fort Wayne, Indiana, uh right uh a couple hundred thousand people, maybe there's a a couple dozen

50:11: plumbers in Fort Wayne, Indiana. So you're building out this whole vertical to try to rank for the one plumber who's

50:18: searching for SEO for plumbers in Fort Wayne, right? there's just so little search volume when you get that hyper

50:25: specific on local um that usually what we're just going to do is talk about how

50:31: you do SEO and then build out the core 30 based on SEO. You can have specific

50:36: landing pages below it uh for the different verticals. Uh and definitely I

50:41: would do it under a single uh domain like different niche sites for each one of these. Man, that makes my head hurt

50:48: even thinking about doing that. Um, just because uh just because it's too much.

50:53: It feels like too much. It's like um it's like cold email, right? I I know I

50:58: was talking for a long time about how we're going to do this big cold email thing and I kept trying to do cold email

51:04: and I kept trying it and I kept trying it and cold email just got so freaking exhausting because you burn the domain

51:10: and then you got to warm up a new one and then buy another one and warm that one up and you got to get the demark set

51:16: up for every one of these goddamn domains and you're just going to get burned for spam anyway. And at the end

51:21: of the day, when I added up all my cost for what my employees were doing, what the VAS were doing and the and the to

51:28: get all this set up and warmed up and everything, at the end of the day, it's just like, god damn, just pay for ads.

51:35: It's cheaper than burning all these uh cold email domains. So anyway, um what

51:40: what you're talking about just sounds so exhausting. Um I I I keep it all in one domain. uh you can talk about the

51:47: specific verticals uh especially if you have case studies or talk about case studies uh then that can be quite

51:53: helpful in those specific verticals all providing topical relevance for your main domain which talks about SEO all

52:00: right let's see uh George has through GHL and it's 30 a month cool but I think

52:05: GHL marks it up GHL is kind of a bastard about that it's kind of funny like GHL's marketing strategy obviously brilliant

52:12: right they're the number one marketing platform on the interwebs s these days. Uh but they basically like it's $300 a

52:19: month um for the plan that almost everyone has and they pay $300 a month in customer acquisition costs, right? So

52:26: they have a 40% affiliate. Uh a lot of their big affiliates get a payment on top of the 40% offer. Um so basically

52:35: the entirety of GHL's uh subscription is going to affiliate payments and the

52:41: company is only profitable because of their usage fees. So, they mark up all of their usage fees. This isn't

52:46: surprising. Of course, they do. They're a business. Uh, but Yex, I think, is actually less expensive than that if you

52:52: go through Yex, but you might also need a volume discount to do it. I'm not completely sure. In general, uh, I would

53:00: advise that you not use Yex. It's a good way to waste a whole bunch of money. Uh,

53:06: like I can't imagine why they delete citations when you cancel the

53:11: subscription. It feels like just a spite thing. Um, and there are other companies

53:16: that do [ __ ] like that, too, and I just don't use them. Like, if I make changes, if I do things, uh, and then I cancel

53:23: your monthly subscription and you want to undo all of that stuff, then I'm I'm not going to sign up. Like, you're not

53:28: going to lock me in to a forever monthly payment because I'm going to like hold

53:34: you hostage with a bunch of [ __ ] if if you cancel. I mean, what kind of business practice is that? like how how

53:39: are you gonna Anyway, I I'm off on a bit of a tangent here. Eric asks, "Is lead snap worth it?" Hinrich says, "Yes, I

53:46: agree." Um, you guys will pro perhaps not be surprised that I get a lot of

53:53: people who reach out to me asking me to affiliate their software tools. Um, I

53:58: don't I only affiliate the tools that we actually use. Uh, Lead Snap is one of them. We use them at my agency. on

54:05: Thursday, day one of my 10K challenge. Um, with no sales call, uh, so no one

54:12: has asked about this, but that's fine. Um, in order to sign people up with no

54:17: sales call, it has to be low ticket, right? I'm not going to be able to get people to sign up for a $2,000 a month

54:22: SEO package without a sales call, not using like my YouTube channel or anything like that. The whole point of

54:28: this is starting over, right? Like, it wouldn't be very fun for you to watch me like deal with leads from my YouTube channel. That's not a very interesting

54:34: challenge. Uh so this is starting completely from scratch, not using anything like that. Um and that

54:41: challenge, the reason I brought it up, it's the what I'm going with it's a low ticket GBP management offer. Um I'm

54:48: going to go at least to this to start I'll tell you guys at least to start it is 147 a month is what my offer is going

54:56: to be. Um, and for that 147, we're going to do the GBP audit that we do for all

55:02: of our new SEO clients. It takes like an hour. Um, then we're going to do a very quick GBP landing page update. Just

55:09: title tag H1 local business schema. Really quick, again, something that my

55:14: employee can do in a half hour, 45 minutes. The third thing we're going to do is connect their GBP to Lead Snap.

55:20: And we're going to use Lead Snap's GBP posting tools. We're going to use Lead Snap's uh review response tools. Um, and

55:28: we're going to use Lead Snap's uh photo drip tools along with the Lead Snap

55:34: citations. So, the first month of this offer, especially considering ad spend, is going to largely be break even and uh

55:41: the money will come in in future months because costs in future months are almost zero. So, this whole 10K

55:47: challenge, the offer that I built around it that we're going to start running ads, we'll see how it does. You guys can

55:53: see the details on Thursday if you want or you can check out the recordings. All of that is going to basically be using

55:58: lead snap as a low ticket offer to get in the door with businesses with

56:04: clients. Demonstrate values, demonstrate results. Um Brian, man, if you pay me a

56:10: million dollars an hour, [ __ ] I'm there. You just tell me when. All right, James. Um okay. Yes. Asking

56:18: about lead snap pricing. So, Lead Snap is $59 a month for up to 10 GBPs. I

56:24: think that's the price. So, it's like six bucks a month for your first 10, assuming you have 10 clients. Otherwise,

56:29: it's 59 a month. That's the starter. And then the citation is 20 a month on top of that per business. I don't know.

56:37: There might be a citations only package. Um, I don't know because we use lead snap for more than just the citations.

56:44: So, we used to use local dominator for all of the local rank maps and I had an affiliate link for local dominator and

56:50: we used it uh but we switched to using lead snap because of the citations. Um

56:56: the local rank maps are very similar between lead snap and local dominator. The two tools are almost the same price.

57:02: Um I think lead snaps local rank maps are a little bit better because it gives

57:08: you the top 3% data. Uh you can view all of your competitors very easily. local

57:13: dominator didn't allow that, but I would not have switched tools just for that minor benefit. We switched because of

57:19: the citations with Lead Snap. Uh hopefully that that makes sense. And uh

57:24: yeah, Brian, if you use this link, if you do use the link, it uh the 59 a month, you get like a it's a 30-day free

57:30: trial and then it's half off for the first three months uh if you use the affiliate link. But yeah, so it's 59 a

57:37: month and then the citations and it's $20 a month, but like I said, it's really a $20 onetime charge.

57:45: Yep. And James has the link. There it is. And Jay, explain that. Perfect. So, people are already all over me. Phone

57:52: numbers and ma titles. Nope. Um, I would not. Uh, I would not put the phone

57:58: number on meta titles. Been on for99. Don't like five. I don't know what that

58:03: means, George. I'm just scrolling past it. No problem. Oh, here we go. Some G4 uses. Let's see if this is good. I use

58:10: G4 for reporting traffic to site and specific pages. Yep. Okay. So, that's what it does. But honestly, like for

58:16: local SEO, I don't care about organic traffic to the site. That's not a metric we're watching. It's not a metric we're

58:23: trying to improve. I'm trying to improve how many calls they get and how many GBP interactions they get. Those things are

58:29: not reported on G4. All right. So, let's come back up to Billy. How you doing,

58:34: Billy? What you got for me today? Hey, how you doing? Yeah. Um, first of all, I I I I I have lead snap. They do

58:42: do just citations if you want to use it for that. I don't recommend that. I recommend the whole enchilada, but they

58:48: they they told me they do do that. But I am having some issues with lead snap on

58:54: how to post as far as the structure goes as far as putting my Google business

58:59: profile secondary categories in and then under those putting the correct uh uh uh

59:06: service niches in. I can't figure out how to do that. Uh, so if you could have the guy from Lead Snap come in and sort

59:12: of give us some tutorial, that'd be fantastic. What are you trying to do with Lead Snap? Try to get what and to where?

59:18: Trying trying to post. Okay. Trying to post my my categories and service niches

59:24: through lead lead snap as opposed to going in and going through Google Business Profile. Do you trying to update them through Lead Snap?

59:30: Yeah. Yeah. And that's the problem I'm having as far as updating the Google business profile through Lead Snap or

59:36: should I just go straight to the Google business profile and do it on my own because that's pretty quick if I do it on my own. Yeah, I remember I asked about something

59:43: like that and I think here, let me see if I can pull up the chat. I had uh Jordan is their support guy and he does

59:50: a great he does a great job. Yeah. Yeah, he's cool, dude. Yeah,

59:56: I I think what I'm remembering is he said you that uh Google doesn't allow those changes to be made.

1:00:03: That's what I think is correct, but I didn't know for sure. So, yeah, that that really wasn't my question, but

1:00:10: since we're all talking lead snap, I thought I'd talk lean snap. And it's a great great gig. Go ahead and get it. I

1:00:15: recommend everyone do it. Yeah, I I I'd have to ask him. I don't want to sit here and keep scrolling up and up and up, but anyway, um I'd have

1:00:23: to confirm to be sure. I'm not sure honestly like those aren't things that we very often change any like we don't

1:00:29: often make any changes on the GBP really. Um so I know we did have an

1:00:34: issue where we had a client who updated their primary category and then Google changed it back even though it was

1:00:41: locked in lead snap. And what the lead snap support said is with a primary

1:00:46: category change, uh, it's going to display the new primary category, but it's not actually changed yet. It says a

1:00:53: pending change, and then if Google denies that pending change, it reverts back. So, it's still locked because the

1:00:59: primary category never actually changed. Uh, not exactly what you asked, but hey, I figure I got to say something to make

1:01:05: me sound like I know what I'm talking about if you ask questions I don't know the answer to. So, that's that's my plan. Um, yeah. Yeah. Well, that really

1:01:12: wasn't my question, but I guess I could jump back into the queue, but uh my question No, go ahead. We we we we uh we we went

1:01:18: off topic. Go for it. Yeah, there you go. My question is, okay, so you set up your your your four

1:01:24: secondary categories, you got your 30 service niches, and then boom, you have it all there. Then you go into the first

1:01:30: month. How uh if you do all those pages, that's $1,200 for PBNs. That's a lot.

1:01:38: Okay. I mean, just if you do them all at once. So then how do you figure out what you start with the first month? Does

1:01:44: that sort of make sense? And that first month I mean you're blowing you more

1:01:49: than you're charging the person almost if you put all the PDN. Yeah. So we don't do that, right? We're never gonna

1:01:55: Yeah. I don't want to do that. So So how do you figure out that first month where which of those secondary categories or

1:02:02: service is you start off with? Does that make sense? Yeah. Yeah. No, absolutely. So the first month I walk through most of what our

1:02:09: base package is earlier, the GBP audit, landing page audit, the manual walkthrough, and then we'll do one

1:02:16: article. Uh that's it. Just one article. Uh we'll pick one of the categories or services, you know, based on what's the

1:02:22: site missing, what is service the client care about, you know, what gets them excited. Uh we'll do that one, we'll

1:02:28: publish it, we'll source a link to it, and then we'll do the internal links. Um that's it. Um that's that's our first

1:02:35: month for most clients. Uh we charge $2,000 a month. That's our minimum. Uh month two we do seven articles and the

1:02:42: month three we do seven and so on and so forth. So to do a core 30 it's going to

1:02:48: take them like three months before we get all the way through it. Um my price

1:02:53: point is around $300 per article. It's a little bit less than that. If you run the math on 2,000 divided by seven, it

1:03:00: works out to I think $286, something like that, but I round to 300.

1:03:06: Um, and if they're in a highly competitive space, right, like again, plastic surgery in New York City, the

1:03:14: $2,000 a month package won't do anything for them, right? Like seven articles a month, that ain't going to move the

1:03:19: needle on a highly competitive space. So, uh, in that case, we're going to

1:03:24: take a little closer look and try to figure out what do they need, how is it going to work. So, we have a three

1:03:30: location, uh, HVAC contractor in South Florida. Uh, HVAC contractor, very, very

1:03:37: competitive in South Florida. If you've ever been in South Florida, you can't throw a rock without hitting an HVAC

1:03:42: contractor. Um, so we took a look at he had a three location site and he had

1:03:48: like 30 or 40 pages on the entire domain and most of their competitors who were

1:03:54: ranking in their three cities had, you know, 180 to 200 pages for each. So we

1:04:00: were like, okay, so that means that we have a target of 500 pages of content uh

1:04:06: that we want to have cranked out by springtime. Uh, it's obviously too late

1:04:11: now. They're not going to get there and rank it now, but 500 pages by springtime

1:04:16: uh that's like seven months away. So say uh you know that works out to like

1:04:22: $20,000 a month uh when you work for how much how many how much content and uh

1:04:29: what we charge per article and what that works out to to get there. So we ended up going a little bit lower than $20,000

1:04:36: a month. Uh a little bit less content. Uh and the intent is we'll re-evaluate

1:04:42: in 2 or 3 months. Uh see where the rank maps are. Uh see if it's moving in the

1:04:47: right direction or if we need to accelerate up and increase the publishing velocity. Um so all of our

1:04:53: pricing is based on what scope of work do we think we're going to need to rank on the time scale that the client is

1:05:00: telling us they want to rank in. I don't know. Am I making sense with that, Billy? Yeah. Yeah. That's fantastic. And I

1:05:06: appreciate all the help. You know, it's uh it's crazy. Uh you know, I I won't

1:05:12: follow up on that. You know, I won't do a follow-up question, but that's helpful. I I'll put my hand back up again and I'll come back around. How's

1:05:18: that? All right. Thank you, Billy. Appreciate it. All right. Let's see. I'm guessing your

1:05:24: name is Sandro. Is that it? Oh, you're muted. There you go. That's correct.

1:05:30: All right. Cool. No space in your name, so you're just trying to challenge me. No problem.

1:05:36: Oh. Did I freeze or was it him? Oh, you're back. All right. What you got for me?

1:05:42: Hey, let me share my screen. Okay. Sure. Here we go. There you go. Mhm.

1:05:50: Share. Oh. Um.

1:06:06: Okay. Um, does it work? I don't see your screen.

1:06:11: Okay. Yeah, I think it's a privacy issue. Okay, then just let me ask you the question. So, I have a a new client

1:06:20: and he has already some categories. He has actually eight categories.

1:06:26: That's a lot. Yeah, that's a lot of categories. Yes. Right. And his primary category is Chinese medicine clinic.

1:06:33: Um but under this category he has no services and his third category in his

1:06:39: third category he has uh six six services.

1:06:46: So I'm wondering like um I think these are like a lot of categories and then

1:06:52: also the the services are under a category that's not the primary category.

1:07:00: Sorry man, I'm not following did. Okay. So they have a lot of categories and

1:07:07: then ser like let me try again. Now you can uh

1:07:12: Yep. Now you can see now. Yep. Okay. Yeah. So here you see this is his

1:07:18: business profile and he has the categories here. Yep. So if I scroll down he has eight

1:07:23: categories here. Mhm. And then the like under the third

1:07:28: category he has all these like six services. Okay. And no services under the other categories. Gotcha.

1:07:35: Yes. So what would you recommend like removing categories here and also like

1:07:40: moving the services to the primary category or so we would want to add more services.

1:07:45: So every category that you have should have some services underneath it. Otherwise why do we have that category?

1:07:51: Right. Yes. Uh I wouldn't necessarily start removing categories unless they are not semantically relevant. Like we

1:07:57: don't want to spam every category and every service that we can possibly think of. We want to try to keep it to

1:08:02: services categories that are semantically relevant to what they're trying to rank for. Uh I'm not familiar

1:08:08: enough with this space. I've never worked in this space. So I can't provide any feedback for you on whether these

1:08:13: are the correct categories, whether they make sense, uh what services might make sense, unfortunately. And this also

1:08:19: looks like the services don't look like they're in uh English. Uh looks like Yeah, it's in Switzerland. It's in

1:08:26: Switzerland. Switzerland. Okay, perfect. Uh so yeah. Um so I like

1:08:33: take So the GMBB Everywhere is a really good tool. Take a look at what their competitors are doing. Uh how does it

1:08:39: work for some of their competitors? But a bunch of categories with no services, I don't usually like that. I like to put

1:08:45: uh services under every category. Otherwise, why do we have the category there? Am am I making sense with that?

1:08:51: That makes sense. So, you would leave all the uh you would leave all the categories and just add services to each

1:08:57: of the categories. I would leave the semantically relevant categories. Um I I'm not familiar with

1:09:03: the space to tell you that all the ones that are there look good. Uh but take a look at them. Take a look at the GMBB

1:09:08: everywhere. See what other businesses have done. Um, and you know, keep the

1:09:13: ones that are semantically relevant for that client, for the services, the keywords that they want to rank for, but

1:09:20: make sure there are services under all the categories. I mean, eight categories, if you even only have four

1:09:25: or five services under each one, your core 30 suddenly becomes the core 50. Um,

1:09:31: yes. Right. So, yeah, that's a challenge, but I mean, you can still do it.

1:09:36: Okay. And I guess like it's most important to have um services under the primary category, right?

1:09:42: No, no, no. We usually will only put like two or three services under the primary category. Uh because we don't

1:09:48: want to link to a whole bunch of different services from the GVP landing page, from the homepage. Uh so we really

1:09:55: just want to choose like, hey, what two or three things do I really really care about that I really really want to get

1:10:01: more calls, more customers for? Okay. Okay. And these two to three services will go under the primary category.

1:10:07: Mhm. Okay. Got it. Perfect. All right. Let's go back to some written ones. We got Matthew here.

1:10:14: My client is a prostadontist. All right. That's a word. Business name

1:10:19: is prostadontics and implant surgery of Manhattan. GBP name. Great. Um Dr. Oh,

1:10:26: so his GBP name is his name as a dentist, not the business name. Seems all the business. So, if um if he's not

1:10:33: ranking very well, like if he's ranking well, then leave it alone. If he's not ranking very well, then I would probably

1:10:40: be very very tempted to change his GBP name to actually match his business

1:10:45: name, right? I said before keyword stuffing and GBP business names, it's

1:10:50: not something we do, but I mean, man, if it's their actual business name, then keyword stuff away. Like, come on,

1:10:57: right? like why not take the free handout if it's there. Um so that's probably what I would do. I would make

1:11:04: sure he's ready to re-record a verification video. Uh and I'd make sure he has all of his documentation ready if

1:11:10: he gets suspended. It's pretty common making a change like that to a um

1:11:18: keywordri GBP title will re Hey, stop chewing on that. Will uh result in

1:11:24: getting him suspended. uh that's a bigger deal than requiring a reverification. Uh so just make sure his

1:11:30: paperwork is correct. Make sure that when you change the GBP name, it's character for character, exactly what

1:11:37: matches the business formation paperwork, insurance paperwork, utility statements, uh lease lease

1:11:43: documentation, anything like that that you have. The more the better. You only get two chances if you get suspended.

1:11:49: You only get two appeals. Uh so make them good. If you trigger a reverification, you can record that

1:11:55: reverification video a 100 times with no worries. Uh that's why the suspension is

1:12:00: a little bit little bit more challenging because you only get two appeals. All right, Gilberto, when you do local SEO

1:12:07: for competitiveness like attorneys, what would be a good advice to pay attention to see good results? Same thing,

1:12:12: honestly. I mean, we're going to price it the same scope of work. Uh we're going to watch the same local rank maps

1:12:19: and we're going to go from there. uh whether it's competitive or not. Right? So, I' I've talked I've mentioned the

1:12:24: plastic surgery New York City. Uh I've you've heard me talk about Lasic eye surgery Chicago uh personal injury

1:12:31: attorney New Orleans. All clients that we've had and we pretty much use the exact same process. The only difference

1:12:36: is for the more competitive spaces, we do more of it, right? And that's I mean that type of hey, if it's more

1:12:43: competitive, we do more of it. uh that comes from our experience in non-local SEO uh which was the agency's my

1:12:50: agency's focus until chat GPT came out. Our focus was non-local SEO and then we

1:12:56: switched to a local SEO uh focus because you know the writing was on the wall

1:13:02: when chat GPT came out that pretty soonformational non-local search traffic was going to go

1:13:07: away. Uh it took longer than I thought like it took almost two years before we started to see that trend really uh kick

1:13:14: into gear. Uh but anyway, so that's why we switched uh focus to local. Uh and

1:13:19: yeah, it's the same type of same type same same process uh that you would do

1:13:24: for a carpet cleaner or mobile. You'll just do more of it. Um how do you

1:13:30: initially plan on getting clients for the 10K challenge ads? Um, I I have no

1:13:36: reasonable way to get uh enough clients to build a $10,000 SEO agency in 3

1:13:41: months uh without using my YouTube channel. Uh, which obviously would be cheating. Uh, unless I run ads. So, it's

1:13:48: going to be ads. Um, ads. Yep. Ads. Uh, sorry to be so boring, but ads. But what

1:13:54: So, the first session um my plan on the first session, stop

1:14:01: chewing on these things. Stop. Yeah, you stop. My plan for the first session, um

1:14:07: I have a dog in my lap just, you know, I'm not like talking to myself. Um my plan for the first session is to by the

1:14:16: end of the first session, hit play on the Facebook ads. So, we're going to build a landing page together for the

1:14:22: offer. Uh we're going to and the landing page is on high level. We're going to make sure the Facebook pixel is working.

1:14:29: Uh some of the technical stuff I'll have done beforehand, like nobody wants to watch me set up a Facebook pixel uh or

1:14:35: connect a domain to high levels. So some of that stuff we'll have done beforehand, but we'll walk through the landing page. We'll do an email

1:14:42: sequence. Um and we'll walk through the Facebook ad campaign setup. So you'll, you know, we'll write the ad copy, we'll

1:14:49: generate some images, uh we'll do the targeting for the ad copy, and then my goal by the end of day one is to be

1:14:55: hitting play on the ads. And then the next session we'll see, hey, how' the ads do? What do the metrics look like?

1:15:01: What what's the next step that we need to do? Um, yeah, the link for that I'll put it on. Oh, that's a good idea to put

1:15:07: it on the school calendar. I should really make a note of that. You'd think I would have thought of that. I didn't

1:15:13: though. Thank you. I'm going to put a note right now. Add link to 10K

1:15:19: challenge to school calendar. Yes. Excellent. That's a very obvious thing I

1:15:24: should have done. All right. for the business name and the GBP, do you add LLC to the end or a friendly business

1:15:30: name? So, if they have one already, I wouldn't edit the business name to add

1:15:35: the LLC or anything like that. But if you're dealing with a suspension, if you're dealing with a reverification, if

1:15:42: you're dealing with anything where a Google employee is going to get involved, I would edit the business name to exactly match whatever the

1:15:48: documentation paperwork you have. We have I have a client and they have a pain management clinic. Uh there's like

1:15:54: nine locations and can you can you be quiet please? I'm talking and they have like nine locations and um one of their

1:16:03: locations got suspended. We submitted an appeal to get the suspension lifted and the GBP name did not have LLC but the

1:16:11: documentation on the lease had the business name with the LLC. The appeal was denied. We changed the business name

1:16:18: on the GBP to add the LLC. ressubmitted the appeal with all the same paperwork and it was approved and reactivated. So,

1:16:27: I wouldn't change an existing one to make it match exactly, but if you're dealing with a suspension or reverification, I would make it match

1:16:34: the paperwork exactly. If the paperwork is non-public, right? So, if you're talking about a license or something

1:16:41: like that, like public paperwork, uh you should change it to match the paperwork. Google employees will go and look up

1:16:48: public documents like that. But if it's a lease agreement, insurance paperwork, stuff like that that's non-public, you

1:16:54: can make very quick edits to that documentation before you submit it to make sure it matches the GBP if you

1:17:00: don't want to change the GBP name. But the paperwork you submit must match the GBP character for character or you're

1:17:06: going to probably get denied. All right. Why are different heat maps have different rankings?

1:17:12: Uh different heat maps work different. I think uh lead snap uh they are rolling

1:17:18: out an update in the next week or so to improve their accuracy. I think their accuracy is really strong. Honestly uh I

1:17:26: think the local dominator accuracy is a little bit better. Um but uh lead snap

1:17:32: is rolling out an update here in a week or two that should hopefully fix that. Um I'm I've not heard of page so I don't

1:17:40: know what that is unfortunately. Jay. All right. For a handyman business, how do you answer this question? Do you want

1:17:45: to add a location customer? I would say no. So, you want to have a visible address. So, okay, do you want to add a

1:17:52: location customer? So, if you don't have a visible address, you have what's called a service area business. And a

1:17:57: service area business is very, very hard to rank. Uh, so have a visible address. Even if nobody is ever going to visit

1:18:03: it, uh, it's very, very hard to rank a hidden address. All right. When you say

1:18:09: articles, are these blog articles or permanent web pages? So, it doesn't matter. U those are just uh different

1:18:16: things inside a WordPress website builder. It doesn't matter the URL structure. It doesn't matter whether

1:18:21: they're blog posts. It doesn't matter whether they're web pages. None of that matters. We just want to have the content on the website and we want to

1:18:28: have the internal links set up as we talk about getting the internal links set up. If it's easier for you to do it

1:18:33: as posts, knock yourself out. If it's easier to do it as pages, knock yourself out. The only thing I would comment that

1:18:40: we screwed this up from personal experience is if you're using the highlevel website builder, then I would

1:18:45: suggest that everything is done on pages, not posts, because posts are not

1:18:51: copied in a highle snapshot. This was a horrifying revelation when we figured

1:18:56: this out. Uh cost me like $4,000 to go back and have everything redone, but

1:19:03: that's fine. Hey, we are where we are, so don't make that mistake. Other than that like snapshot thing, it doesn't

1:19:08: really matter. All right. What do you mean by semantically relevant? Great question. Uh semantically relevant means

1:19:15: that Google's algorithm will think they are relevant, right? It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter if I think they're

1:19:20: relevant. It doesn't matter if you think they're relevant. It doesn't matter if your client thinks they're relevant. If you're trying to rank on Google, it

1:19:27: matters that Google thinks they're relevant. And Google relevance is based on semantic uh semantics the language

1:19:33: that's being used. Right? So Google looks at how people engage uh what the goal completion is for the different

1:19:40: websites and the one the websites that have solid goal completion. uh Google

1:19:46: analyzes the language, the word patterns, what words come up frequently, and compares that to all of the other

1:19:52: pages on the interwebs, and then we'll come up with metrics for how often certain words come up that will serve a

1:19:59: goal completion for this specific query. Um, so that's what I mean by semantic relevance. It has to do with how

1:20:05: Google's algorithm works. Uh, don't worry about the details. Really, a good way to do it is if you're using

1:20:11: something with AI, trying to get AI to give you advice. Just make sure AI knows you're doing it for Google's algorithm.

1:20:17: You can even throw in the words semantic relevance. AI will know what that means. Uh, usually that'll be enough to get

1:20:23: your bases covered. All right, let's hop back over to Brian. How are you? What you got from me, man?

1:20:31: I'm doing good, man. Doing good. So, I got to get used to this because I remember coming on here and there was like six or seven people and now it's

1:20:36: like you can only ask one question. Um, so good for you. Yeah. Well, I I do remember those days

1:20:43: also like I I remember multiple sessions where I think it was like you, Brian, the other Brian and me and we just

1:20:49: chatted for an hour about SEO. Don't you guys wish you had joined in the early days?

1:20:56: Um, I'm going to go back to the original question because I now I I have more questions regarding that. So, it sounds

1:21:02: like to me that I'm going back to the GBP and having like two categories, building out a separate GBP in the same

1:21:09: town. Um, cuz he wants to rank for both obviously and

1:21:14: plumber and HVAC. Right. Right. And so, I don't know if that's like a black hack black hack t black hat tactic

1:21:21: to try and like create a separate location like a like an actual physical

1:21:26: location where someone's actually working. So like if Google verification it actually works um if it's even

1:21:32: possible to rank like u like if you did a primary category on that landing page

1:21:39: right so imagine you have two GBPs pointing to the same website

1:21:45: is it better to do something like that like you have primary category for this location is uh plumber and then primary

1:21:52: category for this location as HVAC contractor um or is it That was my original

1:21:58: question. Or is it better just to have the secondary categories from that one location? Gotcha. So you're going to use the same

1:22:04: domain regardless of how it goes. Uh so then I mean if the two GBPs are pretty

1:22:09: far apart, then I might be tempted to use two GBPs and then use the same primary and secondary category for each

1:22:15: one. Uh right? Because now you're basically you have you have physical

1:22:21: locations for this business. So why not use the multiple physical locations to get multiple GBPs? you'll get better

1:22:27: coverage on the maps. Uh proximity, as we've talked about, is of course a rank factor. So even if they're in the same

1:22:33: city name, when people are closer, they're more likely to rank higher. So if they have that ability, 100% get

1:22:40: multiple GBPs. I'd still probably take the approach of having them match

1:22:45: category, primary, secondary categories. If you're pointing to the same domain, obviously don't point them both to the

1:22:51: homepage unless they already exist and already are pointing to the homepage. and are ranking, then leave them alone.

1:22:58: Uh, but if it's a new GBP or something, then I would uh point the second one to an internal page and just basically

1:23:04: build out that structure exactly the same for each one. Take advantage of multiple GBPs to rank better across that

1:23:11: city faster. Okay, they're ranking very well for plumber. I don't know how much more I

1:23:17: can do for plumber. And I mean, they might have a little bit and I'll probably take a screenshot and harass

1:23:22: you in the school community because I know I'm time every second I speak, but um I

1:23:27: guess that confuses me more and I'm sorry to keep doing the redundancy, but um No, no.

1:23:32: So like, right, so if they're ranking really well for plumber, do they have HVAC contractor on their GBP now as a

1:23:38: secondary? Uh well, I actually just got hired because I caught that. And the HVAC

1:23:43: contractor is uh or HVAC services is their their primary category is is a

1:23:49: plumber, but their H1 and title is HVAC services. So he's going to fire his other guy and hire me. So yeah. So I

1:23:57: mean that's a pretty big [ __ ] Um so okay, what we would So primary category

1:24:04: plumber, make the landing page match the primary category. You got it. Um that'll

1:24:10: help them rank higher on plumber. Then you'll have on that home GBP landing

1:24:15: page, you'll have your secondary category, uh, air conditionings, air conditioning repair is what I would

1:24:21: recommend, but if you want HVAC contractor, that's fine. Uh, then you'll mention that and you'll link to a GBP

1:24:27: secondary category page that it basically is going to look like a homepage for an HVAC contractor, but

1:24:35: it's not. It's your secondary category page. Uh, and then that will have a ton of HVAC services, potentially even more

1:24:42: HVAC related categories underneath it. But so does it make so you'll almost

1:24:49: treat it like a multilocation business because if you do the search on Google, so back to the semantic relevance

1:24:56: question, right? Uh, one is it semantically relevant or not? Well, um,

1:25:01: what does Google think, right? So, if we do plumber New Orleans and Air Conditioning Repair New Orleans,

1:25:08: obviously I would expect no overlap on the top three results, right? Boom.

1:25:14: Boom. Boom. And right, there's no overlap. Three

1:25:20: completely. Actually, I'm wrong. Wow. Look at this, Brian. Look at this. This is actually good news for you. I'm going

1:25:26: to share my screen. So, I did plumber New Orleans, Mr. Rooter. Great. Na Nattles Air Conditioning, Plumbing, blah

1:25:32: blah blah. So, they're ranking for plumber New Orleans, and that's a fairly competitive city, you know, 5 600,000

1:25:38: people. This isn't Fort Wayne, Indiana. Uh, and their primary category is HVAC contractor. You can see it on on the

1:25:45: business right there. HVAC contractor is their primary business category, and they're ranking in the top three for

1:25:50: plumber. And then if I look at air conditioning repair, same guys, Nattles, air conditioning, plumbing, and

1:25:56: everything. So, this is exactly the type of structure uh that I would suggest that you mimic what Nattles is doing

1:26:02: here. So, what I'm going to do just so you have it, I'm going to grab ah [ __ ] UTM. Oh, sorry. I shouldn't

1:26:08: curse. Stupid UTM parameters. So, I'm going to drop that link so you have it.

1:26:14: um cuz I think that's a really good example cuz they have managed to rank in a fairly competitive city for two highly

1:26:21: competitive primary categories, plumber and it looks like their categories HVAC contractor, not air conditioning repair,

1:26:28: but they're obviously ranking for air conditioning repair. Um beyond that, if I look below the top three, I see no

1:26:36: other no other repeated domains. It's really just that one business that's

1:26:42: managed to rank for both. So that's what I like. It's it's going to be hard to rank for a second category that's so

1:26:49: competitive on the same GBP, but I think it will be easier to rank for the second

1:26:54: competitive category than rank a second GBP for that category, right? Because

1:27:01: Google, if if Google is sending people to your GBP and that they're having a good experience, they have good goal

1:27:07: completion, you're answering the damn phone, you're pro, you know, you're making people happy, they're not calling other businesses after they talk to you,

1:27:14: that goes a long way in terms of building uh trust and reliability with that GBP. Uh, and it makes it more

1:27:21: likely that you're going to be able to get that same GBP ranked because you're already building that up, right? Just

1:27:26: like if there's this one domain, I can't remember what it is, but all of the domain is is a bunch of like animated

1:27:32: gifts. And if you go back and look at the very very early pages that they

1:27:37: published, it was a bunch of animated GIFs and then content about those gifts

1:27:43: that was on there. Uh, but if you look at their newer stuff, it's a bunch of animated GIFs and no content because

1:27:49: Google knows that domain is for animated GIFs. So, they don't need content to show Google, to teach Google that's what

1:27:56: they're there for anymore. I don't know. Hopefully that ranks. Uh hopefully that makes sense. Um yeah, hopefully that

1:28:03: makes sense. Uh okay, Billy, what you got?

1:28:08: Yeah, I I'm I'm pretty fascinated about your challenge and and I don't know how much you want to go into now. I I'm on

1:28:15: your AI mastery pro. I can't find it anywhere here, so I'm not sure where we're going to find Oh, it's not on there. I just made the

1:28:20: note like uh Gilberto asked if it was going to be in the calendar and I was just like, "Yeah, it sure should be, but it isn't. I'll have to fix that this

1:28:27: afternoon." Okay, so if I got this right, you're running ads and then your ads are are

1:28:33: are going to a landing page and the landing page is selling the Google business profile audit basically, right?

1:28:40: And so there's not going to be any sales calls and you're charging buck 47 a month and you hope to get to $10,000 a

1:28:47: month in recurring revenue through that business model. Is that correct so far?

1:28:53: Uh sort of right. So um there is obviously part of the goal would be an upsell to actually do a fully managed

1:28:59: local upsell to SEO. But yes, the that's the basics of it.

1:29:05: Got it. Okay. And and so we're going to see everything along the way. Everything you're talking about, we get to see

1:29:11: behind the curtains what you're doing to pull that off. Is that correct or not? 100% correct. It's kind of scary. I

1:29:17: mean, I'm going to share my screen, build landing pages, build Facebook ads. Yeah. Okay. And the whole idea is not to have

1:29:23: to get on the phone with people to sell this stuff, right? Is Is that Is that Is that correct? That is correct. I hate getting on the

1:29:30: phone with people. Yeah, I know. Because I I'm I do that way too much. I'm trying to figure out how not to do that.

1:29:36: Yeah. But but the but the idea if I got this right here I is is to do this for something that's a lower ticket item a

1:29:43: buck 47 and then once they know like and trust you you upsell them to the SEO. Is that what you're sort of doing

1:29:50: for the ones that qualify? Yeah. So somebody signs up and they have a really great looking business and you know we

1:29:56: can we can do some research and see uh what the business is like if they have multiple employees, stuff like that or

1:30:02: if they're in a highly competitive space where they're just not going to rank. Uh then

1:30:08: what we would do uh what my plan is to do is to install like the highlevel uh

1:30:15: text chat bots and sort of start to have conversations with them about what they

1:30:20: would actually need to do in their location potentially. But but if I got this right, you're

1:30:27: going to do it so anyone could do it. I don't mean a you know bad way, but you're not going to do it as Caleb the

1:30:33: SEO god. You're going to do it as as Joe Schmo. Is that right or or not? Am I am I kind of catching this or am I not?

1:30:40: You are correct. I will not be doing it as Caleb the SEO god, but thank you for that. Uh I have a uh new business name.

1:30:49: Uh so it's not a new business name. It's a business that I've had before. Uh that it is obviously it's my business, but no

1:30:55: one knows that. It's called Take Two Labs. Uh the last time we used this uh business name is when we uh ran the

1:31:02: Facebook ads campaign and got 97 plumber clients in 6 months, but that was with a

1:31:08: phone salesfunnel. Um so I'm basically going to try to do something similar without the phone salesunnel. So how are

1:31:16: you going to publicize this? Are you going to publicize it through just through our community here or you going to do some all new YouTube video saying,

1:31:23: "Hey, I got this thing going and come check it out." What what are we looking at? So, for you guys in the pro group, uh

1:31:30: you'll be invited for every session. I don't know how far in advance they'll all be scheduled. It might be like,

1:31:37: "Hey, 5 minutes notice. I'm jumping on to take a look at some ad performance. Here's the link." Uh so, we'll see,

1:31:43: right? Um all of the recordings will be available in the pro group. Every

1:31:48: recording uh that you'll be able to walk through and see everything, all of that will be in the pro group. for the modern

1:31:54: SEO tier. Um, which is the other tier that a lot of you guys are all also in.

1:32:01: And by the way, if you are in that group, if you are not in that group, let me know. Send me a message on school.

1:32:06: I'll send you an invite so you can join that group for free um without having to pay the $27 a month. Um, they will be

1:32:13: invited every once in a while. So, they're invited to day one. Uh, I might invite them to another day later on. And

1:32:20: then for day one, I've also gone ahead and invited my entire email list. I have no idea how many people will show up. We

1:32:26: might have five people. We might have 80. I have no idea. I've never done anything like this. I might not do it

1:32:33: right. I might not be able to get 10K in 3 months. Um I've never tried to do

1:32:38: something like this, much less doing it completely live in front of everyone. Uh but yeah, we'll we'll figure it out

1:32:44: together. I guess that's part of the plan. Okay. All right. Yeah, I'm I'm anxious to see how it works, man. I'm pulling

1:32:50: for you. Awesome. Appreciate it, Billy. Cool. Thanks. All right. Uh, couple of other questions

1:32:56: we'll hit on. Uh, no one else, please raise your hand. We're over time, so we got five minutes. I'm going to bang

1:33:02: through these. Uh, PBN links, if businesses, so Sandro, I've never tried to rank a business located in

1:33:08: Switzerland. Um, I can't imagine why they wouldn't work, but I can't tell you that they will because I've never done

1:33:14: that. I've only attempted to rank businesses in the United States. James, I'm guessing your question about

1:33:19: encourage run the same ads is based on my challenge. Uh, I would leave that up to you if you want to follow along and

1:33:26: run your own ads. Knock yourself out. Um, all right. And, uh, Brian, you are

1:33:31: correct. I was wrong. Uh, collect your prize. Uh, you should not use LLC on

1:33:38: your Google business profile name. Stuff like that should be omitted. Um, I I

1:33:43: did, uh, check. Uh, stuff like that should be omitted. That's the only exception to your documentation matching

1:33:50: your Google business profile name. Exactly. Uh, thank you for correcting me, Brian. Appreciate you being here.

1:33:56: All right, Robert. Brand new GBP that was suspended right away. First appeal is denied. What if it gets denied the

1:34:01: second time? So, if it's a brand new GBP, that suspension is very common. Uh, we did we got uh over a 100 GBPs

1:34:09: verified. Probably a third of them were like suspended immediately. uh you s

1:34:15: submit the appeal. If it gets denied, submit the appeal again. It gets denied again, no problem. Delete the GBP and

1:34:21: try to verify a new one. Uh there's no nothing lost for a GBP that was brand new anyway. So, yes, set up a new GBP

1:34:29: with the same business info. It'll get suspended again and then try to appeal it again. Um just keep it up. All right.

1:34:36: I got a lifetime membership to GTRA. Great. I've not heard of it. Uh say yes

1:34:42: to the address. So, you want to make sure your address is visible, even if it's a service business. Um, when I say

1:34:49: that it's harder to rank a business with a visible address, it is a lot harder to

1:34:54: rank a business with an with an invisible address. A service area business, based on my own experience,

1:35:00: and then I've also done research and seen what other people have said, it's between 50 uh 50% or more harder to rank

1:35:09: a service area business. So, if you're looking at a client and thinking, man, it's going to cost $2,000 a month to

1:35:15: rank them, then with a vi with a service area business, it would be $3,000 a

1:35:21: month or more. It's often less expensive just to rent office space, right? $1,000 a month. It's depending on what city

1:35:27: you're in, but in almost every city, probably not Manhattan, but in most cities, you can get office space around

1:35:33: $1,000 a month. Uh, I found office space near me for um, it was like $900 a year

1:35:42: is what they wanted for it was like a 300 square foot office space for 900

1:35:47: bucks a year. I mean, come on. Office space is cheap these days. Uh, makes me

1:35:52: happy I don't own commercial real estate. Uh, okay. GHL blog. Gotcha.

1:35:58: Yeah, I I don't use GHL blogs. They they they suck. Uh, okay. Thank you. Uh,

1:36:04: awesome. Matthew, thank you for being here. I appreciate it. Oh, and there's the link that I dropped. Nattles. Good for them in New Orleans. Do you need

1:36:11: images on all the pages? Yes, you need images on all the pages. The pages do need to be developed. If all of the

1:36:17: pages are walls of text, you're not going to be able to get them ranked. You're not going to be able to get them indexed. They need to look like real

1:36:23: pages. They need to have images. They need to have design. They need to have callouts. uh Google is crawling the

1:36:29: internet uh with Googlebot which is rendering all the pages on the most

1:36:34: recent version of Chrome. So it's looking at what pages look like that are ranking well and comparing that to what

1:36:40: your page looks like. And if your page is a wall of text, it won't rank. It probably won't get indexed after AI came

1:36:47: out and uh people ruined it. They ruined all the fun by hooking up uh WordPress

1:36:53: to OpenAI's API and churning out tens of thousands of pages in a few days uh of

1:37:00: just walls of text. Uh Google stopped ranking walls of text. They've gone through many many updates including I

1:37:07: heard while we were on this call uh Google announced another August 2025

1:37:12: spam update. Google is updating its algorithm as fast as possible to avoid ranking AI generated slop. Um, and yes,

1:37:22: you do need images. You need as many images as a well-designed website should have. We'll typically use an image per

1:37:29: couple hundred words. Uh, so 1500 words, we're probably going to have 5 to 10

1:37:34: images on that page. Uh, luckily images are super cheap and easy to generate.

1:37:39: Um, I know Brian, you had mentioned a tool in the pro group that you liked for

1:37:45: image generation. I don't remember the name. I just hired somebody on Fiverr to do it. Um, anyway, yes, you do need

1:37:52: images. How much money do you plan on spending? So, 147 a month means that my

1:37:58: plan is to break even on month one. Uh, I know that my fulfillment costs are

1:38:03: going to be around $60. So that means my goal is to get a sign up for $87 in ad

1:38:12: spend or less. Okay. So the way Facebook ads works uh is typically you want to

1:38:19: spend a rule of thumb three times your expected result to see if the ad is

1:38:25: working or not. Right? So, if I'm thinking my customer acquisition cost should be $87, that means I won't know

1:38:33: if my ad is working until I've spent $260 and not had a conversion, right? But if

1:38:40: I spent $260 and I don't have a conversion, I can be reasonably sure that I'm going to miss my uh customer

1:38:47: acquisition cost target. So then when we think about how much to spend per day, the question really is, how many days do

1:38:54: I want to wait to hit $260 in spend and decide whether I need to change the ad

1:38:59: or adjust other things? Um, so I'm probably not going to do $260 a day because I I don't want to find out in

1:39:06: one day. Uh, but I'll probably be on the order of um of 20 to $30 a day in that

1:39:14: price range. Typically, that's where we'll start with a new ad campaign. Uh $30 a day is right around a thousand

1:39:21: bucks a month. Uh a little bit less than a thousand bucks a month. Um so you

1:39:26: know, six, seven clients a month. Uh that pays for the ads. Um anyway,

1:39:33: hopefully that was helpful. AM James repeating Caleb the SEO god. Man, maybe

1:39:38: I need a YouTube channel name. Uh and other than that, I'm a little bit late

1:39:43: here, so hopefully I can make it to school in time for pickup. Thank you very much everyone for coming, for your

1:39:49: engagement. If anything comes up before next Wednesday, remember Wednesday the 3

1:39:54: is our next one. If anything comes up before that, post it in the group. Send me a message. Uh maybe we'll see you

1:40:00: guys there Thursday for day one of my challenge. Uh if you can make it, great. Show up. I have no idea if it's going to

1:40:07: be interesting or if it's going to be boring. If you want to show up and watch me work, I don't know. Part of me thinks

1:40:12: maybe that's what it's going to be. Yeah, exactly. But I don't know, maybe it's going to be really cool and really

1:40:18: interesting. I don't know. We'll find out. I've never done anything like this and I haven't ever seen someone do

1:40:24: something like this. Um, so I'm coming at this completely cold. But anyway, uh,

1:40:29: thanks again everyone. Uh, I'll get this recording posted by tomorrow. And, uh, beyond that, take care. Bye.
