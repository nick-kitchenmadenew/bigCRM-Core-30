FACT CHECK: ‚ùå INACCURATE
Your Claim: "Companies in the local pack capture 80% of the leads compared to the rest of the companies"

What the Data Actually Shows:

Actual Click Distribution:
44% of local searchers click on Local 3-pack results
29% click on organic results
19% click on paid ads
8% click on "more local results"
Individual Local Pack Position Click Rates:
Position #1: 17.6%
Position #2: 15.4%
Position #3: 15.1%
Total Local Pack CTR: 48.1% (17.6% + 15.4% + 15.1%)

Performance Advantage (Not Lead Share):
126% more traffic than businesses in positions 4-10
93% more actions (calls, clicks, directions)
Trust Levels:
68% of searchers trust local pack listings
27% trust organic results
10% trust paid ads
The Corrected Statement:
"Companies in the local pack capture approximately 44-48% of clicks from local searches, not 80%. However, they do receive 126% more traffic and 93% more customer actions compared to businesses ranking in positions 4-10."

Bottom Line:
While local pack visibility doesn't capture 80% of leads, it still provides significant competitive advantages:

Nearly half of all local search clicks
68% trust rate vs 27% for organic results
Double the traffic compared to lower positions
93% more calls and direction requests
The local pack remains the most valuable real estate in local search, but it's more accurate to say it captures about half of the lead opportunity, not four-fifths.
