Internal linking is a powerful yet often overlooked aspect of SEO. When you link from one page on your website to another, the text you use for that link‚Äîcalled anchor text‚Äîplays a crucial role in how search engines understand and rank your content.

What is Internal Anchor Text?

Internal anchor text refers to the clickable text that connects one page of your website to another page within the same domain. Unlike external links that point to other websites, internal links help establish the structure and hierarchy of your site while passing SEO authority between your pages.



The 6 Golden Rules of Internal Anchor Text

1. Never Repeat Anchor Text

Every piece of anchor text on your site should be unique. Using the same anchor text multiple times dilutes its effectiveness and can appear manipulative to search engines.

2. Incorporate Keywords Naturally

While it's important to include relevant keywords in your anchor text, they must flow naturally within the content. Avoid keyword stuffing at all costs‚Äîit looks spammy and can harm your rankings.

3. Describe the Destination Page

Your anchor text should accurately describe what users will find when they click the link. Think of it as a preview of the destination content, not a description of the current page.

4. Keep It Descriptive Yet Concise

Strike a balance between being descriptive and being brief. Your anchor text should give users and search engines clear context without being overly wordy.

5. Place Links in Body Content

Internal links belong in the main body text of your content. Avoid placing them in:





Headers or headings



Footers



Navigation bars



Sidebars

6. Avoid Using Your Brand Name

Generally, skip using your brand name as internal anchor text. Save your brand for external link building efforts where brand mentions add credibility.
